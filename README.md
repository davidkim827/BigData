# BigData

Please read the pdf files located in each of the sub folders. They are the complete report of the work that was completed in groups/partnerships in Big Data Class.

Project 1: Regarding Datastore technologies, our team implemented statistical analyses within MySQL such as Linear Regression and Standard Deviation. We also attempted to work with Mongo, however Mongo was not the most useful for our dataset. We also used R to create helper scripts to be able to craft our extremely long MySQL queries to be able to perform statistical analyses on our datasets. The SQL queries regarding each analyses have been placed into separate SQL scripts.

Project 2: Regarding analytics, our team ran statistical analyses on a few datasets using the statistical and graphics language, R. Utilizing some of the tidyverse libraries and functions, as well as ggplot, we ran our analyses on educational and salary datasets to see what sorts of relationships could exist. We learned how to navigate through the analytics process on larger datasets, manipulating data and using high level implementations of statistical methods. 

Project 3: Regarding distributed processing on a Spark Cluster, our team ran a predictive text analytics model using SparkML via PySpark by pre-categorizing random academic papers in PDF and DOCX formats, converting those text data in to TXT format, inputting them into a CSV, importing them as a Spark Dataframe object, cleaning the text, and running a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
