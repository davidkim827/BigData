Project 3: Regarding distributed processing on a Spark Cluster, our team ran a predictive text analytics machine learning model using SparkML via PySpark by pre-categorizing random academic papers in PDF and DOCX formats, converting those text data in to TXT format, inputting them into a CSV, importing them as a Spark Dataframe object, cleaning the text, and running a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. We learned about the efficacy and efficiency of a distributed computing model by splitting up the job across multiple nodes as opposed to running serially on one node.
