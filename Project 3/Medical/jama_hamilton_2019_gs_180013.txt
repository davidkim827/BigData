Diagnosis and Management of Infectious Diarrhea Diagnosis and Management of Infectious Diarrhea Keith W. Hamilton, MD; Adam S. Cifu, MD Summary of the Clinical Problem Infectious diarrhea is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide.1 In the United States, 179 million cases of acute diarrhea occur per year.2,3 Most diarrheal illnesses are self-limited and do not require evaluation or treatment beyond supportive care such as rehydra- tion. Some infections do require antimicrobial therapy, and appro- priate use of diagnostic tests and treatments may potentially mini- mize unnecessary costs, decrease adverse events, optimize clinical outcomes, and limit antibiotic resistance. Characteristics of the Guideline Source The guideline was developed and funded by the IDSA, which assembled a panel of experts in infectious diseases, microbiology, gastroenterology, nutrition, epidemiology, and public health (Table). Panel members disclosed potential conflicts of interest regardless of perceived relevancy. No panel members were recused based on conflicts. Several panel members received grants and honoraria from pharmaceutical companies, and 1 panelist received travel subsidies from the International Scientific Associa- tion for Probiotics and Prebiotics. The guideline was externally peer reviewed and approved by the IDSA Standards and Practice Guide- lines Committee and Board of Directors, the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society. The panel performed a systematic review to provide guid- ance on diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea.4 Evidence Base The guideline recommends against testing in uncomplicated cases of suspected infectious diarrhea, including travelers diarrhea, in immunocompetent patients because the likelihood of isolating bacterial pathogens is low and use of antibiotics is almost always unnecessary.4 The guideline recommends testing for specific patho- gens by molecular or culture-based methods in patients with fever, bloody or mucoid stools, severe abdominal pain, or sepsis. This rec- ommendation is based on improved outcomes of patients with severe infection.4 Molecular testing does not yield specimens that can be submit- ted to public health departments and cannot determine antimicro- bial susceptibility. The guideline recommends submitting a speci- men for culture in situations in which susceptibility results would inform clinical care and in which submission of a specimen to a pub- lic health laboratory would inform outbreak response. Using molecular typing, health departments can confirm an outbreak by determining whether organisms from different cases are of the Table.

A stool culture may be needed in situations in which antibiotic susceptibility testing would affect clinical care of a patient or public health responses (strong recommendation; low level of evidence).  Diagnostic testing is not recommended in most cases of uncomplicated travelers diarrhea unless treatment is indicated or the traveler has had diarrhea lasting 14 days or longer (strong recommendation; moderate level of evidence).  Antibiotics should be avoided in most immunocompetent patients with bloody diarrhea but without sepsis (strong recommendation; low level of evidence).  Probiotics may be used to reduce the symptom severity and duration of infectious diarrhea in immunocompetent adults and children (weak recommendation; moderate level of evidence).

A low level of evidence supports this recommenda- tion, but practical concerns of increasing antimicrobial resistance and outbreak response make it a strong recommendation.4 Broader testing, including for viral etiologies, may be indicated dur- ing an outbreak. The guideline cites data, specific to typhoid fever, that show de- creased mortality comparing treatment cohorts with historical con- trols as evidence of empirical antibiotic treatment of patients with infectious diarrhea and sepsis.4 Several clinical trials and meta- analyses have demonstrated that patients with bacterial causes of diarrhea but without sepsis have only modest benefits from antibi- otic treatment. Antibiotic choice in these studies is heteroge- neous, and the studies also show increased risk of adverse events (odds ratio, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.50-3.75) and antimicrobial resistance as- sociated with antibiotic treatment.4 The weak recommendation to use probiotics for acute infec- tious diarrhea is based on moderate strength of evidence, includ- ing a meta-analysis and several clinical trials. A reduction of 25 hours (95% CI, 16-34 hours) in total symptom duration and a reduction in stool frequency on the second day of symptoms were observed in the meta-analysis.5 Data on probiotic use for infectious diarrhea are limited by heterogeneity (definitions of diarrhea, outcomes, pro- biotic selection, treatment duration, and setting). Almost all of the data in this meta-analysis were from pediatric patients, and the ef- fects of probiotics were more favorable among study participants with a viral cause compared with a bacterial cause of diarrhea. In light of these limitations, this recommendation should be interpreted with caution, especially in adults. Benefits and Harms Notable in this guideline is the emphasis of multiplex molecular test- ing. The greater sensitivity of these tests and ability to detect mul- tiple pathogens may have clinical utility6 but, for a disease from which most patients recover without treatment, a more sensitive test will potentially lead to overtreatment. There are few data regarding how the availability of multiplex molecular testing will affect physician be- havior, cost, and patient outcomes. To balance benefits and harms of testing, clinicians should consider patients history, risk factors for severity of illness, and risk of complications. Use of probiotics for acute diarrhea was not recommended in the prior version of the guideline. Although most probiotics have been shown to be safe in immunocompetent patients, there are con- cerns about the safety of some probiotics.7 Because probiotics have been implicated in infections (such as Saccharomyces and lactoba- cilli) among immunocompromised and critically ill patients, clini- cians should weigh the risks and benefits of probiotic use given the available data.8 Discussion Developing uniform guidelines for testing in infectious diarrhea is challenging given low-quality data, variable epidemiologic risks, and emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The IDSA and American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines are consistent in emphasizing that the decision to test for bacterial pathogens should be based on a combination of epidemiologic risks for specific pathogens, risk of complications, immunosuppres- sion, risk of transmission, severity and duration of symptoms, and need for treatment.4,8 Recommendations to treat patients with sepsis and more severe illness are based on favorable comparison with historical controls. Given these results, higher-quality studies are unlikely to be done. The IDSA and ACG guidelines differ regarding the role of probi- otics in acute infectious diarrhea.4,8 The IDSA guideline states that probiotics may be used to reduce the symptom severity and dura- tion of infectious diarrhea in immunocompetent adults and chil- dren, whereas the ACG recommends probiotics only in cases of an- tibiotic-associated diarrhea. Although the proven risks of probiotics are negligible in immunocompetent patients, the benefits are un- certain, with the most compelling data in pediatric patients and pa- tients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Areas in Need of Future Study or Ongoing Research The optimal role of culture-based and molecular diagnostic testing has not been defined rigorously. Studies of specific algorithms with clini- cal end points are needed to guide diagnostic decisions and test se- lection. The question of whether probiotics mitigate acute infec- tious diarrhea has not been answered. Trials with less heterogeneous probiotic formulations are needed for specific targeted populations.
