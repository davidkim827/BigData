2018 Update on Pediatric Medical Overuse: A Review 2018 Update on Pediatric Medical Overuse A Review Eric R. Coon, MD, MS; Ricardo A. Quinonez, MD; Daniel J. Morgan, MD, MS; Sanket S. Dhruva, MD, MHS; Timmy Ho, MD, MPH; Nathan Money, DO; Alan R. Schroeder, MD D espite increasing recognition and action to addressmedical overuse, it remains prevalent. In a recents u r v e y, U S p h y s i c i a n s e s t i m a t e d t h a t 2 0 % o f medical care is unnecessary.1 An analysis of commercial claims data found that 10% to 14% of children are exposed to 1 of 20 services that typically do not improve child health.2 Gaps in the medical overuse movement have been illuminated, including suggestions that the overuse message is sometimes over- simplified and undersupported by evidence.3 Furthermore, initiatives to reduce overuse on a large scale have achieved inconsistent success.4,5 Successful diffusion and increased acceptance of medical overuse themes will depend on careful messaging and grounding in strong evidence. Clinicians will be more likely to reconsider potentially overused interventions if they perceive the message as uncomplicated, compatible with their values and beliefs, and beneficial to patients.6 Our annual reviews of the pediatric over- use literature7,8 align with these recommendations, providing concise summaries of 8 to 10 articles of the highest methodologic quality and the greatest potential to protect children from unnec- essary medical harm. Our objective remains to update pediatri- cians on the latest original research demonstrating medical over- use and to provide an evidence-based foundation for pediatric overuse messaging, education, and practice change. Methods The process by which we identified articles for inclusion was modeled after prior annual reviews of the medical overuse literature.7-11 Screening for potential articles was performed via a structured MEDLINE search strategy and a manual review of tables of contents from selected high-impact journals. The struc- tured MEDLINE review identified articles in PubMed published in 2017 indexed with the Medical Subject Headings term health services misuse or with any of the following words in the title: overuse, overtreatment, overdiagnosis, inappropriate, or unnecessary. The same search was performed in Embase, with the addition of the Emtree term unnecessary procedure. Articles with the terms overuse injury or overuse injuries in the title, articles not written in English, and articles that did not present original research were excluded. The title and abstract of each study identified by the structured MEDLINE search was reviewed by 1 author (E.R.C., D.J.M., or S.S.D.) to determine whether the study addressed pediatric overuse. Screening was augmented by a manual review of all studies published in 2017 within 10 selected high-impact journals: Archives of Disease in Childhood, Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal & Neonatal, BMJ, Journal of Pediatrics, Journal of Perinatology, JAMA, JAMA Pediatrics, IMPORTANCE Efforts to combat medical overuse have gained traction in recent years, but success has been intermittent and shortcomings have been recognized. A commitment to a strong evidence base is needed to more broadly engage clinicians and reduce overuse. OBSERVATIONS A structured MEDLINE search and a manual review of tables of contents from selected high-impact journals was performed to identify original research published in 2017 relevant to pediatric overuse. Articles were scored from low to high for 3 categories: quality of methods, magnitude of potential harm, and number of patients potentially harmed. The top-scoring articles presented in this review highlight examples of safe reductions in treatment intensity, including in the setting of cancer, appendicitis, acute respiratory tract infection, and elective anesthesia. This years articles also provide cautionary examples of rational interventions adopted without a full understanding of potential harms, including pharmacologic migraine therapies, docosahexaenoic acid supplementation for preterm neonates, tight glycemic control for individuals with critically illness, and prophylactic antibiotics for children with vesicoureteral reflux. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The articles represent high-quality, original research from 2017 that may help mitigate overuse. These works should be fundamental to the maturation of the pediatric overuse field. JAMA Pediatr. 2019;173(4):379-384. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.5550 Published online February 18, 2019.

Each of the 10 journal tables of contents were independently reviewed by 2 of the 5 pediatric authors (E.R.C., R.A.Q., N.M., T.H., or A.R.S.) to identify articles relevant to pediatric overuse. All abstracts found to address pediatric overuse by the struc- tured PubMed review or manual table of contents review were then independently evaluated by 3 of the 5 pediatric authors, scoring ar- ticles from low to high for 3 categories: quality of methods, magni- tude of potential harm, and number of patients potentially harmed. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicines levels of evidence,12 which con- siders study design and the individual quality of the study (for example, randomized clinical trials [RCTs] score highly but can be moved up or down in score according to risk of bias). The mag- nitude of potential harm score was patterned after the Joint Com- mission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations patient safety event taxonomy, which emphasizes injury severity and permanence.13 Number of patients potentially harmed was judged according to the frequency of the clinical scenario and the resulting harm. Because the precise prevalence of various clinical scenarios and their associated harms are generally not well described, authors were asked to broadly approximate them in a dichotomous manner as either common or un- common, with common clinical scenarios involving common harms scoring the highest. The 20 articles with the top mean scores and any article for which 1 author scored it highly in at least 2 of the 3 catego- ries were summarized and discussed by the authors via a series of con- ference calls, with group consensus determining which 10 articles mer- ited highlighting in this review. In an effort to maximize scoring consistency across raters, 2 prac- tice scoring sessions were conducted prior to releasing the full set of abstracts to authors. For each practice session, the pediatric au- thors scored the same 5 overuse-related abstracts and then partici- pated in an hour-long facilitated discussion addressing the extent to which their scores aligned with the provided scoring rubric, within each category, for all 5 articles. Given that each abstract was scored by 3 different authors, we evaluated the interrater reliability of our scoring rubric at the conclusion of the study by calculating an aver- age intraclass correlation coefficient with corresponding 95% CI. We used an average intraclass correlation coefficient because our unit of analysis was a mean rating over several raters,14 and we excluded abstracts used for the practice sessions from these calculations. Results The structured PubMed review identified 1446 articles published in 2017 that met our search criteria (Figure). Manual review of these abstracts determined that 51 (3.5%) specifically addressed pediat- ric overuse. The table of contents review included 4216 research articles, 116 (2.8%) of which addressed pediatric overuse. Four articles were identified by both the structured review and the table of contents review. The average intraclass correlation coefficient for our scoring rubric was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54-0.76), representing good interrater agreement.15 Of the 167 original research articles addressing pediatric overuse in 2017 identified by our review (eTable in the Supplement), the top 10 are highlighted here. Nonoperative, Antibiotic Treatment of Uncomplicated Appendicitis Background Between 1% and 8% of children who present with acute abdomi- nal pain to the emergency department are diagnosed as having acute appendicitis. These children usually undergo appendectomy, with the attendant risks of an invasive procedure and general anesthe- sia. Several well-conducted studies involving adult patients sug- gest that nonoperative, antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis may be safe and effective.16 Findings A meta-analysis of 4 single-center prospective non-RCTs and 1 single-center RCT totaling 404 pediatric patients found that nonoperative, antibiotic treatment was successful in 152 of 168 patients (91%).17 Forty-five patients (27%) received interval appen- dectomy within 1 year, 37 (22%) of which were due to treatment failure or recurrence. A separate meta-analysis of 7 prospective and 3 retrospective studies (including 4 of the studies reported in the other meta-analysis) found that nonoperative, antibiotic treatment was successful as the initial treatment in 97% of children.18 While follow-up durations varied, 82% of patients were determined to have long-term efficacy of nonoperative treatment. Total duration of hospitalization and complications were similar between children who received nonoperative, antibiotic treatment vs appendec- tomy. Only 1 RCT was included in the 2 meta-analyses. The evidence quality is 2a (systematic review of cohort studies). Implications For children with uncomplicated appendicitis, nonoperative treat- ment with antibiotics could be considered as the initial treatment strategy. Such an approach would reduce risks associated with surgery and general anesthesia. AmitriptylineandTopiramateforTreatmentofPediatricMigraine Background Amitriptyline and topiramate are frequently used for migraine prevention in the pediatric population.19 Evidence supporting their efficacy for this indication is lacking. Findings A double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT compared the impact of amitriptyline, topiramate, and placebo on migraine reduction in 361 pediatric patients aged 8 to 17 years over a 24-week period.20 Figure.

There was also no benefit of the medications over placebo in terms of total num- ber of headache days and headache-related disability. The trial was stopped early for futility. Adverse events were higher in the amitrip- tyline and topiramate groups when compared with placebo (most commonly: paresthesia, fatigue, dry mouth, and weight loss). Five serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in the medica- tion groups, including altered mood (n = 3), syncope (n = 1), and suicide attempt (n = 1). Sixty-four of 361 patients (18%) who underwent randomization did not have measured end point data. The evidence quality is 1b (individual RCT). Implications The 2 most commonly used preventive medications for pediatric migraine are no more effective than placebo. Greater reliance on nonpharmacologic treatment strategies for children experiencing migraines would limit the harm of serious medication adverse effects. Prophylactic Antibiotics for Urinary Tract Infection and Risk of Renal Scarring Background Because childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) is associated with renal scarring, prophylactic antibiotics have been advocated to de- crease risk of recurrent UTI, with the hope of preventing long-term kidney damage. Individual RCTs have not been powered to detect dif- ferences in renal scarring. Findings A meta-analysis of 7 RCTs of prophylactic antibiotics vs placebo involving 1427 patients demonstrated no significant impact on the development of renal scarring by dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (pooled risk ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.55-1.26).21 A subgroup analysis involving only patients with vesicoureteral reflux yielded similar findings (pooled risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.51-1.24). Approximately half of patients included in this meta-analysis had no or low grade (<grade III) vesico- ureteral reflux at the time of study enrollment, and renal scarring was a secondary outcome in all of the included trials. The evidence qual- ity is 1a (systematic review of RCTs). Implications Although prophylactic antibiotics are modestly effective in preventing recurrent UTIs, the goal of preventing renal scarring is not supported by the summary data from this meta-analysis. Given the high number needed to treat to prevent 1 infection (daily antibiotics for 8 patients for 2 years, or 5840 total doses of antibiotics per the most recent RCT),22 andtheconcernsaboutpromotionofantimicrobialresistanceandother drug-related adverse effects, routine prophylactic antibiotics following UTI should be discouraged. Additionally, the findings bring into ques- tion whether the link between UTI and renal scarring is causal.23 Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics for Pediatric Acute Bacterial Respiratory Tract Infections Background Antibiotics are the most frequently prescribed medications in chil- dren, most commonly for otitis media, sinusitis, or pharyngitis.24 Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cepha- losporins, and macrolides are increasingly used based on theoreti- cal benefits against emerging resistant pathogens. Findings An investigation examined 1 retrospective (n = 30 159) and 1 prospective (n = 2472) cohort, both of which comprised patients aged 6 months to 12 years with an acute respiratory infection (acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, or group A streptococcal pharyngitis) and antibiotic prescription within an outpatient network of 31 pediatric primary care practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.25 In the retrospective cohort, 14% were prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics. A propensity-matched analysis found no difference in the primary outcome of treatment failure at 14 days for broad- vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics (3.4% vs 3.1%; risk difference, 0.3%; 95% CI, 0.4% to 0.9%). The prospective cohort found that patient- centered outcomes were not improved for those receiving broad- spectrum antibiotics (no difference in missed school or daycare; slightly worse quality of life) and that adverse events were higher, whether reported by clinicians (3.7% broad- vs 2.7% narrow- spectrum) or patients (35.6% broad- vs 25.1% narrow-spectrum). Although the study used propensity score and sensitivity analyses to address bias, some degree of residual confounding may exist (ie, sicker or more complicated patients being more likely to receive broad spectrum antibiotics). The evidence quality is 2b (individual cohort study). Implications Narrow-spectrum antibiotics (eg, penicillin, amoxicillin) should be the mainstays for antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics do not confer additional treatment benefit and may be associated with more adverse events. Decreased Reliance on Radiation Therapy and Subsequent Risk of Malignancy Among Childhood Cancer Survivors Background Pediatric cancer therapies have resulted in significant gains in cure rates but have also been associated with increases in subsequent malignancy secondary to the original treatment.26 As a result, modifications have been made to therapeutic regimens over the years to mitigate the late effect harms while still providing curative treatment.27 Findings Among a multicenter retrospective cohort of 23 603 patients diag- nosed as having childhood cancer between 1970 to 1999 who sur- vived at least 5 years from diagnosis, declines in the proportion of patients exposed to radiation therapy (78% in the 1970s vs 37% in the 1990s) and the maximum radiation dose received (30 Gy in the 1970s vs 26 Gy in the 1990s) were observed.28 The risk of subse- quent neoplasm decreased for every 5-year increase in diagnosis year (relative rate, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.98), including risk for sub- sequent malignant neoplasm (relative rate, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86- 1.00). Mediation analyses demonstrated that changes in radiation exposure were the primary influence on the decreased rate of sub- sequent neoplasms over time.

The evidence quality is 2b (individual cohort study). Implications Efforts to safely reduce exposure to curative but toxic agents in the treatment of childhood cancer have been associated with a decrease in long-term harms from treatment, including risk of future malignancy. This is a generalizable lesson for all pediatri- cians: efforts should be made to limit medical harms, even among effective, life-saving interventions. Laryngeal Mask Airways and Risk of Adverse Events for Infants Undergoing General Anesthesia Background Perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) are common for children undergoing anesthesia, and infants are at the greatest risk by age group.29 Use of a laryngeal mask airway has been shown to decrease the incidence of PRAE compared with use of an endotra- cheal tube, but previous trials either excluded or did not report the number of infants included.30 Findings This RCT of 181 infants undergoing general anesthesia for minor elec- tive surgery and deemed suitable for either a laryngeal mask airway or an endotracheal tube by their anesthesiologist found that infants who received an endotracheal tube experienced a higher incidence of any PRAE (53% vs 18%; risk ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.79-4.83) and ma- jor PRAE (19% vs 4%; risk ratio, 5.30; 95% CI, 1.62-17.35) compared with infants who received a laryngeal mask airway.31 Major PRAE was defined as laryngospasm or bronchospasm, with any PRAE also including desaturation, airway obstruction, severe coughing, or post- operative stridor. Individuals responsible for measurement of the study outcomes were not blinded to participant treatment assignment. The evidence quality is 1b (individual RCT). Implications Among infants undergoing general anesthesia, use of laryngeal mask airway may reduce the risk of serious adverse events, including laryngospasm and bronchospasm, compared with use of an endo- tracheal tube. A large number of patients who undergo general anesthesia for minor surgery could be managed with a laryngeal mask airway instead of a more invasive endotracheal tube. Less Invasive Surfactant Administration for Preterm Infants Background Surfactant administration improves outcomes for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome in the neonatal intensive care unit.32 While surfactant is most commonly administered after endotracheal intubation, a growing body of evidence suggests that surfactant administration via a thin catheter without endotracheal intubation (less invasive surfactant administration) may be superior. Findings A systematic review and meta-analysis examined 6 RCTs comparing less invasive surfactant administration with surfactant administra- tion after endotracheal intubation.33 Among preterm infants younger than 34 weeks gestational age requiring fractional inspired oxygen greater than 0.3, less invasive surfactant administration decreased bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks (risk ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97) and decreased the need for mechanical ventilation during the neonatal intensive care unit stay (risk ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.93). There was no difference in the risk of death. The included RCTs did not measure long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. The evidence quality is 1a (systematic review of RCTs). Implications Less invasive surfactant administration should be the preferred technique for delivering surfactant to preterm infants who other- wise do not require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Longer follow-up duration is necessary to assess differences in neuro- developmental outcomes. Tight Glycemic Control in Critically Ill Children Background Although early trials of tight glycemic control in adult intensive care unit patients were promising,34,35 subsequent trial data demonstrated an increased risk of mortality with intensive glu- cose control.36 Previous multicenter trials in children, predomi- nantly among those who had undergone cardiac surgery, did not demonstrate a benefit to tight glycemic control.37,38 Studies involving tight glycemic control in pediatric patients with critical illness and other conditions are lacking. Findings A 35-center RCT evaluated tight glycemic control among 713 pediatric patients with respiratory or cardiovascular failure and confirmed hyperglycemia.39 The primary outcome, number of intensive care unitfree days to day 28, did not differ between the lower glucose (80-110 mg/dL) and higher glucose (150-180 mg/dL) target groups, measuring 20.0 and 19.4 days, respectively (P = .58). Patients in the lower target group had greater incidence of severe hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL) compared with the higher target group (5.2% vs 2.0%, P = .03). No signifi- cant difference was seen in 28- and 90-day mortality, ventilator- free days, severity of organ dysfunction, or hospital-free days between groups. A significant increase in health careassociated infections was seen in the lower glucose target group (3.4% vs 1.1%, P = .04). Medical teams were not blinded to study group assignment. The evidence quality is 1b (individual RCT). Implications Tight glycemic control was not shown to be beneficial when treat- ing children with critical illness and hyperglycemia and led to increased risk of severe hypoglycemia and health careassociated infections. Clinicians may safely use higher glucose targets (150- 180 mg/dL) for glucose control and thus avoid adverse effects from insulin overtreatment. Docosahexaenoic Acid and Risk of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Infants Younger Than 29 Weeks Gestation Background Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential component for normal growth and neurodevelopment and is a common additive to com- mercial infant formulas.40 Because preterm infants have lower lev- els of DHA and observational data has suggested that supplemen- tation may be associated with improved neurodevelopment and Clinical Review & Education Review 2018 Update on Pediatric Medical Overuse 382 JAMA Pediatrics April 2019 Volume 173, Number 4 (Reprinted) jamapediatrics.com  2019 American Medical Association.

Clinical bronchopulmo- nary dysplasia and a composite of physiologic bronchopulmonary dys- plasia or death before 36 weeks of postmenstrual age were also slightly increased among infants who received DHA. Bronchopulmo- nary dysplasia is an imperfect outcome, as infants with a history of extreme prematurity who do not meet diagnostic criteria for bron- chopulmonary dysplasia have been shown to have compromised lung function.43 The evidence quality is 1b (individual RCT). Implications Enteral DHA supplementation for preterm infants born at less than 29 weeks gestation does not reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia risk and may increase it. Recommendations to provide high levels of DHA supplementation for very preterm infants should be reevaluated. Discussion Two generalizable lessons emerge from this years review of articles addressing medical overuse in pediatrics. First, all medical interventions, even those that are evidence based and lifesaving, have associated risks. While the benefits of an intervention may very clearly outweigh potential harms, pediatricians should always be striving to limit those harms. Reducing the intensity of an interven- tion, while managing to maintain its effectiveness, can increase the benefit-to-harm ratio. The most striking example from this years review came from pediatric oncology, where we have learned that efforts to safely reduce the intensity of radiation therapy for chil- dren with cancer have been associated with a decrease in second- ary malignancies among survivors, without worsening cure rates. Other examples from our review that demonstrate the benefits of reducing treatment intensity while still effectively healing patients include less invasive surfactant administration for preterm infants, laryngeal mask instead of endotracheal tube intubation for infants undergoing general anesthesia, narrow- instead of broad- spectrum antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections, and nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. The second lesson from this years top pediatric overuse articles is that we should be cautious in adopting rational, seem- ingly common sense therapies that are unproven. Our review highlighted studies testing the following logical assumptions: keeping a critically ill childs blood glucoses within a normal range will decrease their length of stay, the antiinflammatory effects of DHA will reduce the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants, prophylactic antibiotics will reduce renal scarring among children with vesicoureteral reflux, and migraine therapies that are effective in adults will be effective for children. In each case, the intervention was not only found to be ineffective but potentially harmful. Our review is limited by a focus on articles from higher-impact journals, which received closer scrutiny for inclusion (structured keyword search and manual review of all tables of contents) com- pared with articles from other journals (structured keyword search only). While the authors completed an iterative scoring practice using a defined rubric and demonstrated good interrater reliability, a degree of subjectivity in article scoring likely remains. This review did not comprehensively enumerate all existing research addressing pediatric overuse. Rather, in line with prior overuse review methodologies,7-11 we sought to highlight the most important origi- nal research addressing pediatric overuse published in the last year. Conclusions The studies highlighted in our review represent prominent contri- butions to the growing body of evidence that children are frequently affectedand often harmedby medical overuse. Pragmatic dissemination of this evidence will strengthen the movement to reduce pediatric overuse. ARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: December 4, 2018.
