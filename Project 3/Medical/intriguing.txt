Abstract. Prion diseases are among the most intriguing illnesses. Despite their rare incidence, they have captured enormous attention from the scientific community and general public. One of the most hotly debated issues in these diseases is the nature of the infectious material. In recent years increasing evidence has emerged support- ing the protein-only hypothesis of prion transmission. In this model PrPSc (the pathological isoform of the prion protein, PrPC) represents the sole component of the in- fectious particle. However, uncertainties about possible additional factors involved in the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc remain despite extensive attempts to isolate and characterize these elusive components. In this article, we review recent developments concerning the protein-only hypothesis as well as the possible involvement of cellular factors in PrPC to PrPSc conformational change and their influence on the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Keywords. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, prion, cellular conversion factors. Introduction Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion disorders, include several neurological diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), Gertsmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) and kuru in humans [1, 2]. In other mammals, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is found in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in elk and deer [1, 2]. Although the clinical symptoms vary in distinct diseases, they usu- ally include dementia and/or ataxia with progressive loss of brain function, irreversibly resulting in death [3]. The hallmark of prion diseases is the misfolding of the prion protein observed in the brain of affected individuals [1]. Misfolded proteins have the intrinsic tendency to form large extracellular aggregates and fibrillar structures that may in turn form amyloid plaques in a fashion similar to that observed in Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, and many other protein misfolding disorders [4]. In humans, TSEs are divided into sporadic, familial and infectious forms. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common human TSE, accounting for 90 to 95% of cases and affecting mostly individuals over 60 years of age. sCJD has an incidence of one to two new cases per million people each year [5]. Hitherto, no epi- demiologic factors or genetic linkages have been found to be associated with this form of the disease. All familial cases have been shown to arise from mutations identified in the sequence of the gene encoding for the prion protein (Prnp) [2]. More than 20 different mutations have been reported that mostly involve amino acid substitutions and, to a lesser extent, insertion of an additional copy of an eight-amino acid sequence repeat in the N-terminal extremity of the prion protein [6]. Severity and age of onset are variable depending on the position and type of Biomedicine & Diseases: Review The intriguing prion disorders K. Abid and C.

It has been hypothesized that mutations may destabilize the native structure of normal prion protein (PrPC), leading to its misfolding into a protease-resistant form (PrPSc). But proof of this concept has yet to be dem- onstrated. Familial CJD, and GSS syndrome, accounts for 510% of human prion disease cases and exhibits au- tosomal dominant transmission [6]. Infectious forms of the disease represent less than 1% of reported cases and include kuru, iatrogenic CJD and the recently described variant CJD (vCJD). Kuru was spread by ritual mourning cannibalism among New Guinea tribesmen, the outbreak reaching its peak in the mid 1950s and gradually decreas- ing upon cessation of cannibalism [7]. However, cases were still being reported in the 1990s, demonstrating that prion disease incubation time can exceed 40 years [8]. Iatrogenic cases of prion diseases have been reported and consist of transmission of the disease through the use of contaminated human-derived products or incomplete de- contamination of surgical instruments [9]. The majority of iCJD cases have come from hormone therapy gathered from cadaveric human pituitary glands and dura mater collected from affected individuals [10]. Finally, vCJD emerged in the mid-1990s following human consumption of cattle affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) [11]. Although this disorder is very rare, it has drawn considerable attention from the public and led to severe economic and political consequences in Europe and in the United States. The two main reasons for this impact include the unique nature of the infectious agent and the fact that it is impossible to accurately estimate the number of upcoming cases of vCJD due to the very long incubation time of the disease in humans [1214]. In this review we will discuss the structure and biochem- ical characteristics of both PrPC and PrPSc and provide an update of the latest data concerning the protein-only hypothesis. We will also review in detail the potential mechanisms and cellular factors involved in prion con- version. Here, we refer to PrPSc as the misfolded form of PrP, which has been shown to be infectious; PrPres is used to refer to the proteinase K-resistant form, which has not been proven to be infectious. Structure and properties of PrPC and PrPSc The nature of the infectious agent responsible for TSE has been the subject of intense debate over the past de- cades [15]. Initially, the infectious agent was thought to be a virus with an extraordinarily long incubation time. But the fact that it resisted conventional anti-viral inacti- vation procedures [16] led to the hypothesis that the in- fectious agent is devoid of nucleic acid and instead con- sists of a replicating protein [17]. In 1982, Prusiner and co-workers isolated a protease-resistant glycoprotein and proposed that it was the active component of the infec- tious agent, which they called prion (for proteinaceous infectious particle) [18]. The characterization of the gene encoding for the prion protein along with structural and biochemical studies during the mid-1980s started to re- veal the unorthodox and fascinating aspects of prion biol- ogy [1921]. One of the most surprising particularities of the prion protein is its ability to be folded in at least two isoforms, PrPC being the normal protein and PrPSc being the pathologic conformation (where C stands for cellular and Sc for scrapie). The two isoforms consist of the same amino acid sequence and have not been shown to contain any different chemical post-translational modifications [22]. The structural change from PrPC to PrPSc consists of a drastic alteration of the structure as well as the bio- chemical properties of the protein [23]. Indeed, PrPC sec- ondary structures contain 42% alpha helix and 3% beta sheet. Upon conversion into PrPSc, the beta-sheet struc- ture becomes prominent, with 43 vs. 30% for alpha helix [24, 25]. As a result of the structural differences, PrPSc is insoluble and relatively resistant to proteases, while PrPC is soluble and protease sensitive. The prion protein is well conserved among species and dis- plays overall similar structures observed through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of recombinant proteins [2629]. The polypeptide comprises 253 amino acids before post-translational modifications. Maturation of the protein involves cleavage of the N-terminal end by a signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the removal and replacement of the amino acid sequence 232253 by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, for- mation of a disulfide bridge between two cysteine resi- dues and glycosylation of two asparagines (Fig. 1) [1, 30]. The mature human PrPC consists of 209 amino acids, the length varying slightly in different species, mostly due to the number of repeats of the aforementioned eight-amino acid sequence (the octapeptide repeat region) localized in the N-terminal region [6]. Mature PrPC can be divided in two distinct regions: one flexible N-terminal region that is essentially unstructured and comprises amino acids 23125; and a C-terminal region comprising amino acids 126231, composed of three alpha-helical structures and a short beta-sheet motif. Helices 2 and 3 are stabilized by a disulfide bond between cysteine 179 and cysteine 214 [31]. PrPC is a glycoprotein that may contains two N- linked oligosaccharide chains at asparagine residues 181 and 197 for human and N180 and N197 for mouse PrPC. In Syrian hamster, more than 50 different sugar chains have been shown to be attached to PrPC [3234]. Oligo- saccharide chains are added in the ER, further modified and extended to contain sialic acid in the Golgi (Fig. 1). Although PrPC possesses two glycosylation sites, the pro- tein is found as a mixture of mono-, di- or unglycosyl- ated forms, depending on the neuronal region and species [35]. But the physiological significance of these differ- ences remains unknown. The fact that PrPC glycosylation 2344 K. Abid and C. Soto Cellular factors in prion diseases is conserved in mammals argues for an important role of the sugar moieties. Another characteristic of PrPC is the presence of a gly- cosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor at the C-termi- nal end of the polypeptide. This tail is added in the ER, following cleavage of the hydrophobic C-terminus frag- ment, and it enables PrPC to be targeted and attached to the exterior leaflet of the cell membrane (Fig. 1) [30, 36]. PrPC is found mostly in the cholesterol- and sphingo- lipid-rich membrane domain, also known as the lipid raft [3739]. However, part of the PrPC pool is constitutively present outside of the lipid raft domain, and internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Some of the protein molecules are recycled to the cytoplasmic membrane [30, 40]. This type of endocytosis is unusual for a GPI- anchored protein since PrPC is devoid of a cytoplasmic domain that usually recruits clathrin-coated pits. This may suggest that some unknown proteins can interact with PrPC and function as an adaptor to enable PrPC to be internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [41]. That may be important since the exact conversion site is currently unknown. Electron microscopy studies of both scrapie-infected N2a cells and brain tissue have shown that PrPSc is observed in late endosomes and lysosomes [42, 43]. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that, conversion may be initiated in these organelles by virtue of acidic pH and then further amplified in the lipid raft. Interestingly, low pH has been shown to favor aggregation of recombinant PrPC into PrPSc-like structures [4446]. The function of PrPC remains largely unknown. Over the past decade several possible physiological functions of the protein have been proposed [47, 48]. Not surprisingly, as it is found in signaling molecules-rich lipid rafts, PrPC has been shown to be involved in a signal transduction pathway leading to neuroprotection [4951]. Another widely studied putative function of PrPC concerns the binding and metabolism of copper [52]. A role in normal brain copper metabolism is suggested by the finding that the octapeptide repeats of PrPC are able to bind copper within the physiological concentration range [53, 54]. In animal models, significant changes have been detected in the levels of brain copper in scrapie-infected mice, before the onset of clinical symptoms [55, 56]. Furthermore, in human sporadic CJD there is a decrease of up to 50% in brain copper levels [56]. PrP knockout mice display lower copper levels, but unaltered concentrations of iron and zinc in the synaptosomes [54]. However, constitutive and conditional PrP knockout mice are viable and show Figure 1. Biosynthesis of mature PrPC. mRNA is translocated from the nucleus and translated by ER-associated ribosomes into the precur- sor protein (1). The 23-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide directs the polypeptide to the ER, where PrPC undergoes several post-trans- lational modifications: removal of the signal sequence, removal and replacement of the C-terminal end by the GPI anchor, formation of a single disulfide bridge and optional N-glycosylation of two asparagine residues (23). PrPC is transported from the ER to the Golgi, where N-linked oligosaccharides are modified to produce the mature and complex sugar types (45). Mature PrPC is then trafficked to the lipid raft domain of the membrane, where it is attached to the outer leaflet through the GPI anchor (67). Cell. Mol. Life Sci. Vol. 63, 2006 Biomedicine & Diseases Review Article 2345 no major physiological or behavioral changes compared with wild-type animals, suggesting that PrPC may not be an essential protein, at least in mice [5759]. The prion hypothesis The protein-only hypothesis postulates that PrPSc is the infectious particle responsible for prion propagation and that it can replicate by inducing the autocatalytic conver- sion of PrPC into its scrapie isoform [1]. This hypothesis gained great support with the finding that highly purified PrPSc produces the disease when injected into wild-type animals [18] and with the discovery that PrP knockout mice are resistant to prion infection [57]. Neverless, skep- tics argue that definitive proof, consisting of in vitro gen- eration of infectivity by misfolding of the prion protein, is largely missing [15, 60]. Several strategies have been followed in order to defini- tively probe the prion hypothesis [15]. One of the most studied, but thus far unsuccessful, has been to gener- ate infectious mammalian prions starting from PrPC harboring several mutations found in familial TSE-af- fected patients. Even though some properties similar to PrPSc were found among several mutant PrPs tested [61, 62], none of them have been shown to be infectious in animals. Another strategy has been based on the in vitro induction of full-length or truncated recombinant PrP protein misfolding, as well as synthetic fragments of the polypeptide [15]. Although several synthetic polypep- tides were shown to harbor PrPSc-like properties (e.g. formation of aggregates, enriched beta-sheet structures etc.) [44, 6366], none of the constructs tested have been able to induce TSE-like disease in wild-type ani- mals. Recently, a recombinant PrP fragment lacking the N-terminal one-third of the polypeptide was assembled in vitro into amyloid fibrils and was found to induce a TSE-like disease when injected in transgenic mice overexpressing the same truncated portion of PrP [45]. While this finding brings additional support for the prion hypothesis, it poses several problems, a major one being the fact that the disease was observed in animals overexpressing a truncated PrP protein and not wild- type mice. This is significant since it has been shown that transgenic animals overexpressing PrP may sponta- neously develop a prion-like disease [62, 67, 68]. One of the latest and most solid bits of evidence in favor of the prion hypothesis consists in the demonstration that PrPSc generated in vitro by cyclic amplification of the misfolding event was shown to be infectious in wild- type Syrian hamsters [69]. However, this experiment still could not completely rule out the involvement of other components in the infectious units since PrPSc was formed in crude brain homogenate. Factors involved in prion conversion Even though the body of evidence in favor of the prion hy- pothesis is very compelling, alternative models have been suggested, involving viruses, virinos and other infectious agents containing small RNAs [60, 7072]. In particular the putative participation of nucleic acids as part of the infectious particle is still under consideration. Retroviral RNA has been shown to co-sediment with PrPSc [73, 74], and short (< 4 kb) RNA fragments are released after nu- clease digestion from purified infectious fractions [75]. Several reports have demonstrated that PrPSc can interact with RNA with variable affinity [7678]. However, the specificity of these interactions still remains to be estab- lished, as recently described [79]. One of the most important issues concerning possible component(s) other than PrP involved in prion transmis- sion is to distinguish between factors that are part of the infectious particle, as opposed to cellular factors that are involved in the conformational change. If the additional factors must be part of the infectious particle, then the infectious units would not be composed solely of PrPSc. Alternatively, additional factors may need to be present in the host to sustain proper prion replication. These fac- tors may be cellular components presumably engaged in other functions in the infected cells that accidentally participate in prion conversion. In the latter case, these additional factors (termed conversion factors) should not be considered part of the infectious particle, but rather host-encoded molecules that aid prion replication. Some evidence supports the existence of conversion factor(s) in the prion replication process. The existence of host factor(s) was first suspected when transgenic mice expressing both human and mouse PrPC were challenged with human prions. Surprisingly, mice co-expressing both proteins were resistant to prion replication, while mice expressing only human PrPC (HuPrPC) developed the disease following human PrPSc inoculation [80]. This suggested that mouse PrPC (MoPrPC) was able to inhibit the conversion when co-expressed with HuPrPC. Interest- ingly, transgenic animals expressing a chimeric protein consisting of pieces of the human and the mouse gene were also susceptible to infection with human prions [81]. This result enabled the authors to conclude that MoPrPC inhibited the conversion of HuPrPC by binding to an ad- ditional factor. Further studies performed by the same group showed that the host factor, termed protein X, was able to bind PrPC through its C-terminal end [82]. Other evidence supporting the involvement of conversion factor(s) includes genetic studies in mice suggesting that other loci besides Prnp (the gene encoding for PrP) may modulate the time course of disease in PrPSc-innoculated animals [83]. In addition, biochemical studies of cell- free conversion of PrP have shown that partially purified hamster PrPC is not converted when mixed with purified 2346 K. Abid and C. Soto Cellular factors in prion diseases PrPSc; on the other hand, conversion is restored when the cell lysate is added to the sample [84, 85]. Similar results have been obtained using our recently described PMCA (protein misfolding cyclic amplification) technology [K. Abid and C. Soto, unpublished results] and suggest that unknown factors present in brain homogenate are essen- tial for the conversion. Finally, data in the chronically in- fected mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a indicate that some cell clones can sustain prion replication, while oth- ers cannot [86, 87]. Interestingly, the expression levels or subcellular localization of PrP in cells sensitive and resistant to infection appear to be the same [K. Maundrell and C. Soto, unpublished results]. These data might be in- terpreted as suggesting that some cell clones express the appropriate quantities of the conversion factor, whereas others do not. While the nature of the conversion factor remains elusive and it is also unknown whether the factor is one single molecule or several different ones, several compounds have been shown in vitro to bind PrP and promote prion replication. Sulfated glycans have been shown to be able to bind PrPC [88], to stimulate PrPres formation [89] and have been observed in PrP amyloid plaques from scrapie- infected mice [90]. Conversely, heparinase III treatment of infected cells in culture diminish levels of PrPres [91]. Small, highly structured RNA, vertebrate RNA, and ho- mopolymeric nucleic acids such as poly(A) and poly(dT) or nonspecific DNA have been shown to facilitate prion conversion in vitro from recombinant or hamster brain PrPC [85, 9294]. Since the lipid raft harbors both isoforms of the protein [38], it has been suggested that these domains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids may harbor the mysteri- ous factor(s). Even though no proteinaceous determinant present in these domains has been proven to be absolutely essential for conversion, the cholesterol level in the lipid raft appears to modulate the process [39] [K. Maundrell and C. Soto, unpublished results]. Interestingly, replacing the GPI tail with a transmembrane CD4 protein domain or by a segment of the Qa protein (two proteins located in the membrane but not in the lipid raft domains) prevents the lipid raftPrP association, and results in significant reduction or abrogation of the conversion [39, 95]. How- ever, a recent report showed that in scrapie-infected trans- genic mice expressing PrP lacking the GPI membrane an- chor, abnormal protease-resistant PrPSc was deposited as amyloid plaques, rather than the usual nonamyloid form of PrPSc [96]. Although PrPSc amyloid plaques induced brain damage reminiscent of Alzheimers disease, clinical manifestations were minimal. Finally, it is likely that small ions may also modulate prion conversion. As mentioned in the previous section, PrPC is able to bind copper through its octapeptide se- quence repeat, but the effect of copper at the molecular level and on conversion efficiency is unclear. Copper has been shown to recover infectivity of partially denatured PrPSc [97] and to enhance PK resistance of PrPres [98]. Moreover, copper chelation has been reported to delay the onset of prion disease in animals [99]. Conversely, copper has been shown to prevent infection of N2a cells [100] and inhibit in vitro aggregation of recombinant PrPC into amyloid fibrils [101]. More recently, Supattapones group have reported that in vitro PrPres amplification was inhibited by CuCl2 and ZnCl2 at IC50 (mean inhibiting) concentrations of approximately 400 nm and 10 m, re- spectively [102]. We have observed similar results using our PMCA technology [P. Saa, J. Castilla and C. Soto, unpublished results]. Models of conversion The molecular basis of the PrP conversion mechanism is not completely understood. Several models have been pro- posed and revised on subsequent findings. The seeding/ nucleation model proposes that monomeric PrPSc exists in equilibrium with PrPC (Fig. 2) [103, 104]. In this scenario, monomeric PrPSc would represent a minor and transient isoform of PrP and would be stabilized only when forming ordered aggregates. The stabilized oligomers act as nuclei to recruit monomeric PrPSc into the polymer in a process that is much faster than the initial formation of the seed. The template-assisted model proposes that PrPSc contains the refolding instruction that is applied to PrPC upon inter- action of the two isoforms catalyzed by the protein X and mediated by the formation of a conformational intermedi- ate [23]. The conversion process first implies the forma- tion of a heterodimeric PrPC-PrPSc unit that would initiate the conformational change of PrPC, becoming homodi- meric PrPSc, as depicted in Figure 2. The latter would sub- sequently interact with other PrPSc dimers and eventually form larger aggregates. In the template-assisted model, the infectious unit is a monomer of PrPSc, and the forma- tion of larger aggregates is not needed for prion replica- tion. Recently this model was challenged by Caughey and colleagues who showed that small oligomers composed of less than six units of PrPSc were noninfectious in Syrian hamsters [105]. In fact, the particles harboring the high- est infectious potential were non-fibrillar structures com- posed of 1428 units of PrPSc. Similarly, in recent years, evidence suggests that large aggregates found in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease and other amyloidoses might also be relatively inert and less responsible for the expansion of the disease compared with smaller aggregates [4, 106]. Fibril formation might be a protective strategy to sequester the harmful oligomers rather than the culprit of neurodegeneration [106]. Thus, growing evidence supports the hypothesis that small ag- gregates of PrPSc rather than monomers or large fibrillar structures can catalyze the conversion of PrPC. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. Vol. 63, 2006 Biomedicine & Diseases Review Article 2347 Based on recent biochemical experiments of prion con- version, we would like to propose a new model of prion replication, termed the nucleated-assisted model (Fig. 2). A key event in this model would be the formation of an intermediate structural state (PrP*) upon binding of PrPC to the conversion factor. The intermediate conformation would enable and prepare PrPC to sustain the profound structural changes leading to PrPSc. The existence of in- termediate states has been the subject of numerous stud- ies [107, 108]. Intermediate states have been described when solution conditions are altered, such as in the pres- ence of metal ions or upon changes in pH [109]. How- ever, the physiological relevance of these intermediates remains to be established. It has long been postulated that mutations along PrPC can destabilize the overall structure of the polypeptide and therefore facilitate the conversion. It is tempting to speculate that a mutant protein could be more unfolded than wild-type PrPC and therefore be more prone to adopt multiple conformations, one of which could represent an intermediate convertible isoform. The next key step in the nucleated-assisted model would be the further structural rearrangement of the protein and its stabilization upon intermolecular interactions with other molecules of PrP*. The formation of the minimum stable oligomer would be the limiting step for the de novo formation of PrPSc. However, in infectious forms of TSE, the infectious agent corresponding to an oligo- mer of PrPSc would catalyze the further conformational changes of PrP* by incorporating the protein into the growing aggregate. In this model there is no equilibrium between PrPC and PrPSc, and the latter isoform exists only as an oligomer or larger polymer. Concluding remarks In recent years, increasing evidence has emerged to sup- port the prion hypothesis. The discipline has never been so close to confirming that PrPSc is indeed the only com- ponent of the infectious agent. One of the main reasons for this progress lies in the fact that in vitro systems to study prion conversion have been improved and opti- Figure 2. Different models for prion conversion. (a) The template-assisted hypothesis proposes the interaction of a PrPC intermediate with a monomeric form of PrPSc and the subsequent conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. The PrPSc dimer would then interact with other dimers and thus form larger aggregates. (b) The seeding-nucleation hypothesis proposes that PrPC and PrPSc are in dynamic equilibrium, but monomeric PrPSc is unstable and become stabilized by the formation of an oligomer that acts as a seed to bind and further stabilize PrPSc monomers, displacing the equilibrium to the accumulation of the pathological isoform. (c) An alternative model, the nucleated-assisted hypothesis, proposes that PrPSc never exists as a monomer, but requires two subsequent structural rearrangements to form the oligomeric PrPSc species. The first step in this model is the formation of a partially unfolded intermediate (PrP*) upon interaction with an endogenous conversion factor. This structural change results in the exposition of hydrophobic fragments to the solvent, facilitating the interaction with other PrP*. This interaction results in further structural changes of the protein to adopt an intermolecular beta sheet. If enough PrP* is present, it is possible to form a stable oligomer containing a minimum number of molecules of the protein. This stable oligomer corresponds to PrPSc, which can then act as an infectious molecule, recruiting PrP* and catalyzing prion conversion. 2348 K. Abid and C. Soto Cellular factors in prion diseases mized since the pioneering work of Caughey and co- workers, who were the first to study prion replication in test tube assays [104]. One of the most interesting issues in prion biology is the possible involvement of additional factors during the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. Our cur- rent conversion models harbors two main uncertainties: the existence of the conversion factor and the nature of in- termediate forms required for conversion. The discovery of either one may boost the discovery of the second, since the conversion factor may be responsible for shaping the intermediate structure. In vitro models of PrP conversion are an invaluable tool in helping to uncover the molecular details of prion replication by allowing reconstitution of PrPSc propagation using purified components. These dis- coveries would not only allow a better understanding of the conversion process itself, but would open new avenues for novel therapeutic strategies against prion diseases. Acknowledgements.
