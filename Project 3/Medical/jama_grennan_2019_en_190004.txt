Addition of an Intimate Partner Violence Intervention to a Nurse Home Visitation Program Editor's Note Addition of an Intimate Partner Violence Intervention to a Nurse Home Visitation Program Dara Grennan, MD; Thomas B. Cole, MD, MPH Intimate partner violence (IPV) is ubiquitous and its health consequences are well known, but there is limited evi- dence from randomized trials to support effective interven- tions to interrupt violence within intimate relationships. In this issue of JAMA, Jack and colleagues1 report no additional improvement in quality of life after adding an intensive intervention to address IPV to an already existing nurse home visitation program for pregnant women expecting their first child. The standard program group and the intervention group both demon- strated improvement in the primary outcome, interview- assessed quality of life at baseline and every 6 months until 24 months after delivery, so no benefit could be attributed to the intervention. Although IPV training was not a compo- nent of the standard nurse home visitation program, expectant mothers were routinely assessed for abuse and referred for services as needed, and this level of assessment and support may have been sufficient to improve the par- ticipants quality of life without the enhancement of the IPV intervention. That is, nurses in both the standard program group and the intervention group were knowledgeable and ready to assist women who had been abused. So what can be learned from this trial? Both study groups reported improvements in quality of life and reduc- tions in violence, without evidence of harm. This suggests that recognizing possible abuse, asking about it, and empathically listening to an abused patients story can help her along the road to self-efficacy, empowerment, and heal- ing, especially when an IPV diagnosis results in appropriate referrals to health, social, and legal services. However, addi- tional services and extensive clinician training, as provided in this trial, may not be necessary. Clinicians should be vigi- lant for the signs and symptoms of abuse and should be encouraged to assess their patients safely and refer them for appropriate services. Evidence from this and other trials suggests that even in the absence of a complex IPV inter- vention, diagnosis and referral of abused women can make a difference.
