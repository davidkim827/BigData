Association of Antibiotic Resistance With Antibiotic Use for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor InhibitorRelated Papulopustular Eruption Letters RESEARCH LETTER Association of Antibiotic Resistance With Antibiotic Use for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor InhibitorRelated Papulopustular Eruption Papulopustular eruption (PPE) develops in up to 90% of pa- tients with cancer treated with epidermal growth factor re- ceptor (EGFR) inhibitors.1 Consensus recommendations for management include emolliation, sunscreen, topical cortico- steroids, and topical and systemic antibiotics, which effec- tively decrease severity of EGFR inhibitorrelated PPE.2 Al- though the initial EGFR inhibitorrelated PPE is sterile, secondary infection increases the severity and duration of PPEs. Higher-grade, refractory cases may show antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection on wound culture.3 This study investi- gated whether use of topical clindamycin and/or oral tetracy- clines during management of EGFR inhibitorrelated PPE is as- sociated with antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. Methods | We conducted a retrospective medical record re- view of the Stanford Cancer Institute Research Database. All patients were screened for inclusion and provided a waiver of consent. Patients included in the cohort were enrolled in the database from January 1, 2012, to July 31, 2016, diagnosed with at least grade 1 EGFR inhibitorrelated PPE,4 and had a subse- quent wound culture of the PPE that yielded bacterial organ- Table 1.

We collected dates of EGFR inhibitor therapy, time and duration of antibiotic exposure to topical clindamycin and/or oral tetracyclines, and bacterial wound culture results, includ- ing antibiotic susceptibility testing. Patients concurrently treated with antiseptics or with no antibiotic duration re- ported were excluded. The study was approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research under the extended approval process. All data were deidentified. To compare patients whose wound culture yielded anti- biotic-resistant bacteria with those whose wound culture did not, age was compared with an unpaired t test. Categorical vari- ables were compared by 2 or Fisher exact test as appropri- ate. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to de- termine whether time from EGFR inhibitor therapy start to first positive wound culture result was associated with antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic exposures were treated as time- dependent variables. All tests were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analy- ses were conducted with SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Results | Among 71 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.4 [13.1] years; 46 [64.8%] male) with positive bacterial wound culture results, the incidence of clindamycin-resistant infection was highest among patients who received topical clindamycin therapy for greater than 4 weeks (n = 19 [63.3%]) vs no treatment (n = 8 [26.7%]) and treatment for less than 4 weeks (n = 3 [10.0%]). The incidence of tetracycline- resistant infection was highest among patients who received oral tetracycline therapy for greater than 4 weeks (n = 14 [46.7%]) vs no treatment (n = 12 [40.0%]) and treat- ment for less than 4 weeks (n = 4 [13.3%]) (Table 1 and Table 2). The risk of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection was greater with increased treatment time for patients with history of oral tetracycline use (hazard ratio, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.45-6.85; P = .004) or prior topical clindamycin use (hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.83-4.50; P = .12). Discussion | In this study, patients who received topical clinda- mycin or oral tetracycline for management of EGFR inhibitor related PPEs had a higher incidence of secondary skin infec- tion with antibiotic-resistant bacteria compared with patients without prior antibiotic exposure, a finding that reached sta- tistical significance with exposure to oral tetracyclines. A greater incidence of resistant infections was seen in pa- tients with greater than 4 weeks of exposure to either antibi- otic, suggesting that longer duration of antibiotic use is asso- ciated with increased risk of developing antibiotic resistance. Our findings are consistent with a previous study5 in acne vulgaris, which found that antibiotic use without concurrent antiseptic therapy was associated with development of anti- biotic-resistant bacteria. Guidelines for EGFR inhibitor related PPE management understandably recommend against using benzoyl peroxide because of potential exacerbation of EGFR inhibitorrelated xerosis and skin irritation.3,6 Given the finding that patients with a history of antibiotic mono- therapy for EGFR inhibitorrelated PPE may develop antibiotic- resistant skin infections, we suggest consideration of concur- rent antiseptic therapy (eg, benzoyl peroxide, dilute bleach baths, or chlorhexidine) during topical or oral antibiotic therapy for EGFR inhibitorrelated PPE. Limitations to this study include the sample size and single- center design. Lifetime exposure to antibiotics, which may re- sult in permanent changes to skin flora, was not assessed. Pa- tient adherence to antibiotic use may have been variable. The effect of concurrent antiseptic therapy on reducing the inci- dence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections has not yet been determined. The risk of xerosis and skin irritation with concurrent antiseptic therapy in this patient population has not yet been determined; however, in our institutional expe- rience, antiseptic-related xerosis can be effectively managed with diligent emolliation. We look forward to future studies that investigate whether the addition of topical antiseptics dur- ing management of EGFR inhibitorrelated PPE may lead to reduction of antibiotic resistance and, subsequently, improved outcome and quality of life in this susceptible patient population.
