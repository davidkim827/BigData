Prescription DrugsList Price, Net Price, and the Rebate Caught in the Middle HEALTH POLICY Prescription DrugsList Price, Net Price, and the Rebate Caught in the Middle Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), such as Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, and Optum Rx, are some of the larger companies that administer the Medicare Part D pre- scription drug benefit. These companies facilitate access to prescription drugs for beneficiaries, and because each company generally has millions of enrollees, they lever- age their size to extract price concessions from pharma- ceutical manufacturers. Because Medicare is not permit- ted to negotiate drug prices directly, the program and beneficiaries rely on PBMs to negotiate on their behalf. Although the federal Medicare program bears most of the costs of the Part D benefit, Medicare beneficiaries also pay for Part D through monthly premiums and out-of- pocket payments when they obtain prescription medi- cations (ie, deductibles, co-insurance, or co-payments). Although monthly premiums have stayed relatively un- changed over the past several years, Medicare spending on drugs has increased, even as PBMs have reported ef- fectively containing drug costs.1 The divergent develop- ments have brought the primary mechanism by which PBMs achieve lower prices under scrutiny. The PBMs do not obtain upfront discounts on most drugs, but instead receiverebatesfrommanufacturersafterthepoint-of-sale. Rebates paid to PBMs are distinct from rebates routinely encountered with other consumer products because these rebates are paid to the PBM and Medi- care (Part D plan) instead of the patient. Furthermore, pa- tients paying deductibles or co-insurance overpay when obtaining prescription drugs that have large rebates be- cause patients out-of-pocket costs are calculated based on the pre-rebated price (list price). For example, a pa- tient with a $1000 drug deductible filling a prescription for a drug that has a list price of $400 and a net price of $300 (rebate of 25%) would pay $400 initially. Similarly, if the patient had 25% co-insurance for prescriptions, the pricetothepatientwouldbebasedonthepre-rebateprice ($100 out-of-pocket instead of $75). In recent years, phar- maceutical manufacturers have consistently increased the list prices of their products, while the amount of re- bates has also increased. Average manufacturer rebates in Part D increased from 10.4% of drug costs in 2008 to a projected 26.1% in 2019.2 Despite these savings, list price increaseshavemovedmorebeneficiariesintocatastrophic coverage under Part D, where the Medicare program (ie, taxpayers) pays for 80% of drug spending.3,4 On January 31, 2019, US Health and Human Ser- vices Secretary Alex Azar proposed to change rules that would effectively eliminate rebates in Medicare Part D and in Medicaid managed care programs. Those rules would classify payments from drug manufacturers to PBMs as kickbacks, making them illegal under the new proposal.1 The secretary suggested that removing re- bates would lower out-of-pocket spending at the phar- macy counter for Medicare beneficiaries, noting the av- erage rebate for branded drugs is 26% to 30% of the drugs list price. It is hoped that if a proposal is enacted that eliminates rebates, pharmaceutical manufactur- ers will discount their products directly. That change, keeping all else the same, could reduce out-of-pocket costs for some patients by lowering the drug list price on which their deductibles or co-insurance are calcu- lated. However, the effect the change would have on Medicare program spending is less clear. This apparent benefit for beneficiaries rests on 2 key assumptions: that beneficiaries will save a meaningful amount of money at the pharmacy counter, and that pharmaceutical manufacturers will voluntarily dis- count list prices if they no longer pay rebates. Neither assumption may be true. Rebates are generally offered to PBMs by pharma- ceutical manufacturers so that the manufacturers prod- uct can obtain preferred formulary place- ment over the products of competitors. As such, in competitive markets, re- bates are sizable because Part D plans can elect to cover some products and not others. In these cases, the presence of multiple manufacturers with head-to- head competitors in categories such as insulins and drugs to treat hepatitis C have class-level re- bates of 66% and 62%, respectively, across all payers.5 In 2016, leading products in these classes had total pre- rebate spending in Part D of $2.5 billion (Lantus Solostar) and $4.4 billion (Harvoni).2 For an individual patient, this would reduce list prices on which their deductibles and co-insurance are calculated from $417 to $142 for pa- tients filling a 1-month supply for Lantus Solostar and from $92 648 to $35 206 for patients filling an 84-day course of treatment with Harvoni, assuming class-level rebates applied to these products. On the other hand, rebates are far less effective at lowering net prices for drugs that either lack rel- evant competitors or for which Medicare requires for- mulary inclusion due to protected class status.

For example, lenalidomide (Revlimid) had a list price of more than $21 000/mo in 2018 and had Medicare pre- rebate spending of nearly $2.7 billion in 2016.2 Rebates average less than 12% in this category.5 Under Medicare Part D, patients using lenalidomide currently pay more than $15 000 per year out- of-pocket for this drug. The same is true for many high-priced, novel drugs in other categories that lack competition. Under the new proposal, even if manufacturers converted their rebates to upfront discounts, only those patients who are taking drugs in competitive classes would realize savings, while patients taking some of the most expensive medications would not. The second assumption, that pharmaceutical manufacturers will voluntarily reduce list prices, may prove even more problematic. There is little reason to expect that manufacturers would discount their prices as much as needed to maintain current levels of drug spending (26%-30% off list prices on average across all products). Instead, the manufacturers may stop paying rebates, make mod- est reductions to list prices, and end up increasing their profits. In the proposal this issue is acknowledged: total drug spending, and thus total costs of Part D, are projected to increase across the vari- ous scenarios evaluated.1 The increased costs of Part D under the new rule could be managed, but it would require focusing on the prices of branded drugs more directly and imparting greater formulary flexibility for the Part D plans for drugs with limited competition. But perhaps more important, the structure of Part D needs to be reexamined. As in virtually every other type of insurance, health insurance should be designed to collect resources from many people to pro- tect the few against financial catastrophe. That is precisely how home and car insurance work. Today Medicare Part D works in reverse, with individuals who need expensive drugs that have lim- ited competition facing unlimited out-of-pocket costs.4 Under a system with targeted use of pass-through rebates or conversion of rebates to discounts, some beneficiaries taking medi- cations in competitive categories would benefit, but premiums would likely increase for all beneficiaries. Savings would also not be avail- able across all categories of expensive drugs and there is no guar- antee that prices will be lowered substantially. A more extensive restructuring should be considered. First, as recommended under the proposed rule, supply chain members PBMs, wholesalers, and pharmaciesshould be paid on a fee basis that is unrelated to the list price of the drug or the size of the rebate achieved. This would be appropriate for the reimbursement of Part B drugs as well. Patients who are prescribed preferred drugs should have more predictable costs, something that could be achieved were formularies required to have at least one product in each category under a co-payment (flat fee) arrangement. Tools such as reference pricing, value-based pricing, or arbitration could be used to ensure that preferred drugs and drugs that have limited competition are priced appropriately and could help ensure afford- ability for patients whose treatment options are limited.6 Second, the administration should consider capping out-of- pocket spending on Medicare Part D for patients reaching the cata- strophic coverage limit and increasing incentives (or penalties) to en- courage manufacturers to charge appropriate list prices and limit price increases.7 To be certain, the current rebate system contains perverse in- centives within the supply chain and increases costs for patients and taxpayers.3 Requiring companies to compete for formulary cover- age and placement based on actual prices could be a step in the right direction. However, discarding rebates without including other checks to pharmaceutical firms pricing may simply increase the cost of the Part D program for taxpayers and patients. Meanwhile the cur- rent proposal1 will fail to help a large share of beneficiaries who take medications that are either required to be on every formulary or face no direct competition.
