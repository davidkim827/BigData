Increasing evidence indicated that an unknown toxic gain of function of PrPsc underlies neuronal death. Conversely, strong evidence indicated that cellular prion protein might be directly cytotoxic by medi- ating neurotoxic signaling of b-sheet-rich conformers in- dependent of prion replication. Furthermore, the common properties of b-sheet-rich isoform such as PrPSc and b amyloid protein become the lynchpin that interprets the general pathological mechanism of protein misfolding dis- eases. Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has been implicated in various protein misfolding diseases. However, the mechanisms of this impairment remain unknown in many cases. In prion disease, prion- infected mouse brains have increased levels of ubiquitin conjugates, which correlate with decreased proteasome function. Both PrPC and PrPSc accumulate in cells after proteasome inhibition, which leads to increased cell death. A direct interaction between 20S core particle and PrP isoforms was demonstrated. Here we review the ability of misfolded PrP and UPS to affect each other, which might contribute to the pathological features of prion-mediated neurodegeneration. Keywords prion disease; ubiquitin-proteasome system; proteasome; misfolded PrP Received: October 21, 2012 Accepted: December 10, 2012 Introduction Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalop- athies (TSEs), develop as central nervous system disease after long incubation periods, and many of which may arise following the consumption of infected materials. Despite their relative rarity (it is estimated that they affect one person per million worldwide annually), they remain in the spotlight due to the unique biological character of the trans- missible agent. The infectious agent is a misfolded and partially protein- ase K (PK)-resistant form of prion protein (scrapie asso- ciated PrP-PrPSc), which directs normal host prion protein to accumulate in the misfolded form. Prion diseases share the following histopathological hallmarks: spongiform vacuolation, severe neuronal loss, astrocytic and microglial proliferation, and accumulation of the disease-associated isoform of the prion protein in the brain, sometimes with the formation of amyloid deposits. The appearance of PrPSc is the initiation of prion diseases, and the misfolded PrP has a nature of conversion and a trend of aggregation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the primary cellular quality control system in eukaryotic cells for select- ing and degrading proteins that are either incomplete, mis- sense, or misfolded, and could potentially form toxic aggregates. UPS is responsible for the degradation of .80% of normal and abnormal intracellular proteins, in- cluding many cellular polymers and misfolded proteins [1]. Aberrations in this system have been implicated in the eti- ology of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative dis- eases, such as mutations in ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), a-synuclein (PARK1), and Parkin (PARK2) [2]. Kristiansen et al. [3] reported that mouse prion-infected neuronal cell lines are more susceptible to cell death after proteasome inhibition. Hectd2 gene that encodes a ubiquitin ligase was identified as a gene influen- cing incubation time for prion disease in mice [4]. Hence, we suggest a linkage between the UPS and prion diseases, which may be important in the neurotoxic mechanism of prion diseases.

Mammalian prion diseases include transmissible mink en- cephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of deer and elk, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. The term prion was first proposed by Stanley Prusiner to distinguish the infectious particle in prion disease as a pathogen from bacteria and viruses, and defined as a small, proteinaceous infectious particle that resists inactiva- tion by procedures that modify nucleic acids [5]. The re- search for scrapie came to be the milestone of the discovery of prion. Stanley Prusiner found that the pathogen of scrapie was insusceptible to any kinds of nuclease. Furthermore, while nucleic acid is vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and ultrasonic wave, scrapie pathogen has the re- sistance to various factors of physical inactivation. On the other hand, treatments impacting proteins can weaken or in- activate the infectivity of the pathogen. Progressive enrich- ment of scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenates for infectivity led to the isolation of a protease-resistant poly- peptide which was later identified as part of the prion protein (PrP) [6]. Griffith [7] first introduced the possibility that the mater- ial responsible for disease transmission might be a protein that had the surprising ability to replicate in the body. This launched the so-called protein-only hypothesis of TSE propagation, subsequently moved forward by Stanley Prusiners group [5]. In the protein-only hypothesis, prion diseases are thought to be resulted from the conformational change of a normal isoform of a prion protein (PrPC) to a protease-resistant, pathogenic form called PrPSc which recruits endogenous PrPC in order to replicate, and forms the quantitative to qualitative changes that damage the nervous tissue. Although they share the same amino acid sequence, PrPC is mainly a-helical, whereas PrPSc is b-sheet rich. In addition, PrPSc is less soluble in detergents and more resistant to proteases. With the amplification of infectious prions in vitro [8], and their recent generation by protein misfolding cyclic amplification from purified re- combinant prion protein with the sole addition of RNA and lipids [9], the evidence for the protein-only prion model is now overwhelming. Despite extensive research, the exact nature of the infec- tious agent is still unknown. This mystery is highlighted by the lack of correlation between infectivity and PrPSc levels [1012] as well as by the existence of PK-sensitive forms of PrPSc [1319]. The facts that minimal infectivity was associated with protein-only inoculations and highly infec- tious prion could be generated in the presence of lipids suggest that accessory co-factor molecules may be essential for prion infectivity in mammals [2022]. And such a co- factor might increase the biological stability of prions, thereby reducing their in vivo clearance. Although it is clear that PrPSc is the main informational molecule in the infec- tious agent, it remains possible that co-factor molecules are required [21]. The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System UPS is consisted of a ubiquitin binding system and a 26S proteasome. The ubiquitin binding system contains a series of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1; ubiquitin- conjugating enzyme, E2; ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3; and deubiquitinating enzymes. The proteasome is a multicataly- tic protease that degrades polyubiquitinated proteins to short peptides. It is composed of two subcomplexes: a 20S core particle (CP) which carries the catalytic activity and a regulatory 19S regulatory particle (RP) which is involved in the recognition of the substrate [23]. The degradation of a protein via the ubiquitin- proteasome pathway involves two discrete and successive steps [24]: (i) tagging of the substrate by covalent attach- ment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to synthesize the polyubiquitin chain proteolytic signal and (ii) degradation of the tagged protein by the 26S proteasome complex with release of free and reusable ubiquitin catalyzed by ubiquitin-recycling enzymes also known as deubiquitinat- ing enzymes (DUBs) (Fig. 1). Conjugation of ubiquitin, a highly evolutionarily conserved 76 amino acid residue polypeptide, to the protein substrate proceeds via a three- Figure 1 The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of degradation Substrate proteins are mono- or multiubiquitylated by the actions of ubiquitin- activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2), and ubiquitin-ligase (E3) enzymes, a modification reversed by DUB enzymes. The dotted line indicates: (i) ubiquitin1 capped unanchored multi-ubiquitin chains impairs 26S proteasome function; (ii) protein aggregates in the pathological state also directly inhibit 20S and 26S function, further contributing to inclusion formation. Interaction between misfolded PrP and the ubiquitin-proteasome system Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (2013) | Volume 45 | Issue 6 | Page 478 step cascade mechanism. Ubiquitin has seven lysine resi- dues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63), all of which are available and indeed used in vivo for chain exten- sion [25]. The significance of complex ubiquitylation pat- terns is only partially understood: K48 chains (which are the most abundant) lead to degradation of the substrate by the 26S proteasome, whereas monoubiquitylation and K63 chains do not specify degradation but have other biological functions, including marking proteins for endocytosis [26]. Initially, E1 activates ubiquitin in an ATP-requiring reaction to generate a high-energy thiol ester intermediate, E1-S ubiquitin. One of several E2 enzymes then transfers the acti- vated ubiquitin from E1 via an additional high-energy thiol ester intermediate, E2-Subiquitin, to the substrate that is specifically bound to E3. E3s catalyze the last step in the conjugation process, namely the covalent attachment of ubi- quitin to the substrate. The 20S CP is a barrel-shaped struc- ture composed of four stacked rings: two identical outer a rings and two identical inner b rings. The eukaryotic a and b rings are each composed of seven distinct subunits, giving the 20S complex the general structure of a1-7b1-7b1-7a1- 7. The catalytic sites are localized to some of the b subunits. The 19S regulatory complex binds flexibly to the 20S cata- lytic core and consists of six ATPases, forming a ring at the entrance of the core and exerting chaperone-like activity [27]. In addition to recognizing ubiquitinated proteins and other potential substrates of the proteasome, a second func- tion of the 19S RP is to open an orifice in the a ring that will allow the entry of the substrate into the proteolytic chamber. Following degradation of the substrate, short pep- tides derived from the substrate are released along with re- usable ubiquitin. These peptides are further degraded to amino acids by cytosolic amino and carboxypeptidases. Prion and Ubiquitin-Proteasome System Role of misfolded PrP in the impairment of UPS It has been reported that prion-infected mouse brains have increased levels of ubiquitin conjugates, which correlates with decreased proteasome function [28]. A number of researches have also been done to explain how misfolded PrP interact with UPS [2931]. Another study revealed an intracellular mechanism whereby toxic prion oligomers impair the proteasome in vivo by inhibiting the catalytic b subunits of the 20S proteasome [29]. It was found that prion infection caused an increase in the steady-state levels of the reporter, indicative of functional impairment of the UPS. Modification of b subunit activities (indicating a loss of activity) was clearly seen in prion-infected cells. The es- tablishment of a transgenic mouse model allowed the func- tional status of the UPS to be monitored, and the data suggested that prion disease in vivo was associated with UPS dysfunction and supported the in vitro studies, indicating that proteasome function was directly compro- mised by the presence of PrPSc or its synthetic mimetic b-PrP. Deriziotis et al. [32] reported that aggregated b-PrP has a high affinity for the 20S particle, and reduced the 20S proteasome basal peptidase activity by stabilizing the closed conformation of the substrate entry channel, which could account for the inhibition of 26S proteasomal func- tion. A recent study suggested a mechanism of proteasome impairment by the direct interaction of b-sheet-rich PrP to reduce gate opening and inhibit substrate entry [33]. This novel mechanism may provide a model for how misfolded, disease-associated proteins might interact with the prote- asome and disrupt its function. The impairment of UPS plays a role in prion infection The UPS is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)- associated degradation (ERAD) where ER-resident proteins, in unassembled or misfolded forms, undergo retrograde transport to the cytosol, get ubiquitinated, and are normally degraded by the proteasome [34]. Lindquist and colleagues [35] first reported that PrP retrogradely transported out of the ER produced the accumulation of PrPC aggregates with some PrPSc-like properties (such as protease resistance and detergent insolubility) in the cytosol of neurons with prote- asome inhibition. And transient proteasome inhibition is sufficient to initiate sustained PrP conversion; even removal of the proteasome inhibitor does not affect the abnormal PrP generation process once it starts. These observations might explain the origin of PrPSc. Both wild-type and mis- folded forms of PrP undergo ERAD [36,37]. A pathogenic PrPC mutant (Y145stop) associated with an inherited prion disease, GSS, is degraded via ERAD [38], whereas another GSS-associated PrPC mutant (Q217R) remains bound to BiP, an ER chaperone, for an unusually long period of time before proteasomal degradation [39]. More importantly, wild-type PrPC molecules undergoing ERAD have been shown to accumulate in the cytosol when the proteasome is inhibited [36,37]. Cells treated with proteasome inhibitors showed to accumulate both detergent-soluble and -insoluble PrPC species, with the latter containing a protease-resistant core and ubiquitin [36]. A separate study showed that inhib- ition of the proteasome in cells led to a significant fraction of endogenous PrPC accumulation in the cytoplasm [37]. With aging, cellular repair mechanisms are characterized by a decrease of protein repair and an increased formation of aggresomes [40]. Therefore, UPS impairment, due to the aging process or during prion infection in vivo, may allow for PrP accumulation into toxic aggresomes. The impair- ment of the UPS may play an important role in prion dis- eases characterized by accumulation of misfolded proteins, but the biochemical mechanisms underlying this dysfunc- tion remain unclear. Increasing evidence suggested that soluble micro-aggregates of misfolded proteins, rather than Interaction between misfolded PrP and the ubiquitin-proteasome system Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (2013) | Volume 45 | Issue 6 | Page 479 larger protein inclusions, are toxic to neurons in neurode- generative diseases [41]. Thus, it is possible that such aggregates eventually overwhelm the UPS, causing a func- tional impairment and further pathogenic transformation. The relationship among UPS inhibition, cytosolic PrP ac- cumulation, and neurotoxicity in prion disease has been widely investigated. Studies indicated that cytosolic PrP ac- cumulation appears to be toxic to neurons [42]. Straight and inducible expression of cytosolic PrP in transgenic mice leads to neurodegeneration in different neuronal populations [43,44]. Cells with higher levels of cytosolic PrP expression are selectively killed by treatment with proteasome inhibitor [44]. More evidence for a toxic role of cytosolic PrP comes from a yeast model in which it was shown that during post- translational targeting of PrPC to the ER, PrPC is missorted to the cytosol and interferes with cell viability [45]. In add- ition, Rambold et al. [46] used a mutant that contains the N-terminal ER-targeting signal but lacks the C-terminal glycosylation phosphatidylinositol (GPI) signal sequence (PrPDGPI, which can spontaneously adopt a misfolded conformation) to analyze the subcellular localization of the different PrP constructs. The results showed that only in the cytosol the accumulation of misfolded PrP induced apop- tosis. Apoptotic cell death was also induced by two patho- genic mutants of PrP, which are partially localized in the cytosol. Experiments described above proved the neuro- toxic nature of cytosolic PrP in prion pathogenesis. Strong evidence indicated that cellular prion protein might be dir- ectly cytotoxic by mediating neurotoxic signaling of b-sheet-rich conformers independent of prion replication [47]. Paradoxically, cytosolic PrP accumulation in human primary neurons treated with proteasome inhibitors has been reported: instead of causing cell toxicity, it protects against Bax-mediated cell death [48]. Despite much con- flicting data, aberrant PrPC trafficking to the cytosol, which does appear to occur via ERAD [36,37], may play a role in prion pathogenesis. UPS plays an important role in the dispose of misfolded PrP in the cytosol of neurons. Thus, the speed of cytosolic PrP accumulation beyond the UPS capacity or the inhibition of UPS may account for the ag- gregation of cytosolic PrP and its toxicity collection. Actually, the impairment of the UPS leads to cellular dys- function and apoptosis through many different mechanisms, as the UPS is also involved in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and control of apoptosis [49]. UPS functionality increases in prion-associated disease Oxidative stress is another important factor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegen- erative diseases, which can account for the activation of the proteasome complex relatively less reported in neurodegen- erative diseases such as prion disease, Alzheimers diseases (AD), and Parkinsons diseases (PD). A proteomic analysis reported that ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCH-L1) found to be enriched in AD [50]. Amici et al. [51] reported an increase of proteasome functionality in prion-associated disease and a higher incidence of protein oxidation in both aged and scrapie-infected sub- jects. Previous publications have reported that oxidized pro- teins are preferentially degraded by the 20S proteasome [52,53] and that mild oxidative conditions may regulate and enhance proteasome-mediated degradation [5457]. Thus, the activation of the proteasome complex may be consid- ered as a way of counteracting the effects of oxidative stress. Another proteomic analysis revealed that the UCH-L1 is a major target of oxidative damage in AD and PD brains, suggesting a direct link between oxidative damage and the neuronal ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination machinery [58]. One of the major consequences of aberrant UCH-L1 activity is an impaired proteasome proteolytic system, which will lead to accumulation of damaged pro- teins and formation of protein aggregates. Therefore, the confrontation process between UPS and oxidative damage or misfolded PrP may show us a peak shape function of the activity of UPS. If the counteracting capacity cannot balance the severe oxidative stress, UPS would suffer the oxidative damage and cause protein-misfolding disorders. Proteins involved in perturbed UPS potentially serve as disease biomarkers To control and prevent prion diseases, an early diagnosis is urgently needed. Further analysis of proteins involved in perturbed UPS may help elucidate mechanisms behind mis- folded PrP pathogenesis and provide new sources of biomarkers. Ubiquitin-B (UBB) and UBB-like proteins play a central role in the UPS. In AD brain areas where cell death has been reported (i.e. the hippocampal region CA1 and the subiculum), the expression of mutant ubiquitin that indicated the inhibition of proteasome might reach a critical level [59]. UBB1 (a frameshift mutant form of ubiquitin) has been observed in the hallmarks of AD, as well as other tauopathies and in polyglutamine diseases (e.g. Huntingtons disease). It has been shown in vitro and in vivo that UBB1 inhibits the proteasome and gives rise to downstream effects (e.g. a behavioral phenotype; im- paired contextual memory) [60] (Fig. 1). UBB1, as a result of genomic mutations due to dinucleotide deletions, may lead to an accumulation in hallmark structures neuro- fibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques, and neuropil threads [61]. A neuropathological analysis revealed the de- position of PK-resistant prion protein, abnormal accumula- tion of mitochondria in the vicinity of PrP deposits, and expression of mutant ubiquitin (UBB1) in NFTs and dys- trophic neurites [62]. Interaction between misfolded PrP and the ubiquitin-proteasome system Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (2013) | Volume 45 | Issue 6 | Page 480 One of the most common types of familial PD is caused by mutations in PARK2, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin. Mutations in PARK2 cause early disease onset, with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the sub- stantia nigra in the general absence of Lewy bodies [63]. The first E3 ligase to be implicated in long-term potenti- ation was UBE3A (also known as E6-AP) [64], the mutation of which causes Angelman syndrome in humans, a disease that is associated with defects in neuronal development. Furthermore, UBE3A is localized to dendrites and spines, and its absence leads to reduced spine density and length [65]. In addition to PARK2 and UBE3A, an increasing number of E3 genes are linked to neurogenetic disorders, including UBR1 (JohansonBlizzard syndrome) [66], NHLRC1 (Laforas disease) [67], and CUL4B [68], BRWD3 [69] and HUWE1 [70]. About 100 DUBs have been identified in the human genome, and most of them belong to two major families: ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs) and ubiqui- tin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) [71]. UBPs are mainly responsible for cleaving ubiquitinsubstrate and ubiquitin ubiquitin isopeptide bonds, reversing protein ubiquitylation. UCHs, on the other hand, remove small adducts from the ubiquitin to maintain the monomeric pool. UCH-L1 plays a crucial role for the clearance of abnormal proteins in UPS. It is one of the most abundant proteins, making 12% of soluble proteins, and is exclusively localized in neurons [72]. It has multiple functions: (i) it is a deubiquitinating enzyme; (ii) it is a ligase; and (iii) it stabilizes monoubiqui- nated proteins. Down-regulation of UCH-L1 occurs in PD and AD. Its concentration is inversely proportional to the number of tangles [51]. However, liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified that proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD and UCHL1 was found to be enriched [46]. A20 (also called TNFaip3) [73,74], the N-terminal domain of which is a deubiquitinating ligase, regulates the expression of proinflammatory genes in re- sponse to various stimuli. Most types of cells do not consti- tutively express A20, but rapidly up-regulate A20 mRNA expression after stimulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB), which links A20 to the negative feedback regula- tion of NF-kB activation. The results suggested that paracaspase-mediated A20 cleavage in T lymphocytes is necessary for a proper NF-kB activation [75]. BAG-1 is a binding partner of Hsp70. When BAG-1 is overexpressed, it plays an inhibitory role in the degradation of Tau and consequently results in an accumulation of Tau in neurons and contributes to tangle formation [76]. The cellular PrP binds to the C-terminus of Bcl-2 [77], and PrP may disrupt the chains of Bcl-2 molecules at the homo- meric association site in the transmembrane region [78]. Additionally, toxicity has been linked to cytosolic PrP accu- mulation, when PrPC co-aggregates with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 with toxicity abrogated after overexpression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 [46]. Another protein, phosphocatenin, when accumulating in the form of aggresomes, may con- tribute to a proteasome dysfunction [79]. Sporadic forms of AD and PD diseases are the most fre- quent forms, and together with prion disease, they belong to the so-called protein misfolding disorders as they share a common feature in the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. In addition, those diseases cause neurodegen- erative effects. Therefore, the UPS in those diseases and the possible consequences due to the accumulation of aberrant proteins may accordingly share some common features. Proteins of UPS involved in AD, PD may have a key pos- ition in further researches of identification of the compo- nents of this system in prion diseases. Conclusion The mechanism of cell death in prion diseases is unknown but is associated with the production of a misfolded con- former of the prion protein. The deficiency of functional PrPC cannot make clear the gross pathology of neurodegen- erative disease. Another explanation that PrPSc itself is neurotoxic does not adequately explain many observations: in transgenic mice where neuronal PrPC is deleted during the course of infection, but extraneuronal replication of PrPSc continues [80], neurotoxicity does not occur despite extensive PrPSc accumulation, as well as in mice in which the GPI-anchor is removed, detaching PrP from the cell surface but allowing replication to occur away from the cell bodies and processes [81]. Misfolded PrP accumulation in the endolysosomal system causes dysfunction of the de- gradative pathway, resulting indirectly in an increased burden on the UPS. The degradative capacity of the UPS is also known to decline during the aging process [82], and combined with the effects of neuronal stress in the brain, this will further incapacitate UPS function, resulting in neuronal dysfunction [83]. Recent studies have identified a possible pathway for prion clearance that involves milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein (MFGE8)-mediated phagocyt- osis of prions by microglia and a co-factor that could reduce the affinity of PrPSc for MFGE8 [84]. It reminds us of the existence of co-factors acting on UPS, thereby pos- sibly reducing the infectious agent clearance in vivo. It is not yet clear whether the UPS impairment is a primary or a secondary event in prion disease pathophysiology, and work is still ongoing to clarify this ambiguity. Whatever the pathogenic factor might be, misfolded, disease-associated PrP, accessory co-factor molecules or oxidative damage, there can always be a disruption of UPS function. Thus, misfolded PrP accumulation beyond the UPS capacity or UPS impairment in a variety of ways may account for the aggregation of misfolded PrP and its toxicity collection. Interaction between misfolded PrP and the ubiquitin-proteasome system Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (2013) | Volume 45 | Issue 6 | Page 481 It is possible that a mutual promotion exists between the impairment of the UPS and the accumulation of misfolded PrP in the neural cytosol (Fig. 1). The pathogenesis of prion disease is likely to be multi- factorial, but the potent inhibition of the proteasome by pathogenic PrP is likely to result in neuronal perturbation and contribute to the widespread neuronal loss. The key feature of prion disease, autocatalytic conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, may form a positive feedback loop by inhibiting the UPS. Given the significant role that has emerged for the UPS in protein-misfolding disorders combined with the age-dependent decrease in UPS activity, designing drugs that improve neuronal UPS function may offer a successful strategy to slow or prevent neurodegenerative diseases in which misfolded proteins are toxic. Therapeutic use of deg- radation pathways in prion disease to overcome a dysfunc- tion in protein homeostasis may turn a curse into a blessing. UPS-targeted therapeutic interventions will provide new perspectives for our combat against neurode- generative disorders over the years. References 1 Wang J and Maidonado MA.
