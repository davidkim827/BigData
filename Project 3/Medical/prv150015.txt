Kapadia, MD; Todd D. Nebesio, MD; Susan E. Myers, MD; Steven Willi, MD; Bradley S. Miller, MD, PhD; David B. Allen, MD; Elka Jacobson-Dickman, MD; for the Drugs and Therapeutics Committee of the Pediatric Endocrine Society I nhaled corticosteroids are widely used as effective first-linetreatments for various chronic respiratory illnesses, includingasthma, cystic fibrosis, and allergic rhinitis.1 Although the long-term use of ICSs has a more favorable safety profile than oral corticosteroids, uncertainty about systemic complications persist. In children, the long-term use of oral corticosteroids can lead to compromised linear growth and bone mineralization, diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2) (DM), Cushing syndrome, obesity, and sup- pression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Inhaled corticosteroids have a similar adverse effect profile but with less frequency and severity. We review the endocrine effects of ICSs in children and the properties of the various formulations as they relate to these adverse outcomes. We have provided grading of the evidence associated with our conclusions and recommen- dations based on guidelines from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, in which a lower number indicates better evidence (scale, 1-5), and A is the highest grade of recommendation (scale, A-D).2 Case Presentation A 7-year-old girl presented with altered mental status and a new- onset seizure. She was well until that day, when she developed cough, fatigue, and fever and then had a generalized seizure. When the ambulance arrived, her blood glucose level was 24 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). In the emergency department, her blood pressure was 85/50 mm Hg, and her pulse was 125/min. The results of head imaging and a full sepsis workup were normal. Her medical history was signifi- cant for asthma and seasonal allergies. At home she took a regi- men of fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler (two 110-g puffs twice daily), salmeterol xinafoate (21 g/d), albuterol sulfate as needed, and cetirizine (10 mg/d) to which she was adherent. She had a 5-day course of prednisone 4 months prior. Her growth was normal. She had a sodium level of 140 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1), and her potassium level was 4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1). A serum cortisol level at the time of the hypoglycemia was low (2.1 g/dL) (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 27.588). Further testing revealed a morning cortisol level of 0.8 g/dL and an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level less than 5 pg/mL (to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 0.22), suggesting central adrenal insufficiency (AI). A low-dose 1-g ACTH stimulation test confirmed AI with a peak cortisol level of 1.4 g/dL (reference range, >18 g/dL). Thy- roid function test results, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, and prolactin levels were normal. Maintenance hydrocortisone treatment was initiated, and the family received stress dose corti- costeroid education. Her pulmonologist reduced the inhaled corti- costeroid (ICS) dose to 330 g/d after adding montelukast, and the asthma remained well controlled. The hydrocortisone dose was gradually weaned and hydrocortisone use discontinued. Six months later, an additional low-dose ACTH stimulation test result was normal with a peak stimulated cortisol level of 19.9 g/dL. The HPA axis suppression was attributed to her ICSs. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are widely used as first-line treatment for various chronic respiratory illnesses. Advances in devices and formulations have reduced their local adverse effects. However, as delivery of ICSs to the lungs improves, the systemic absorption increases, and an adverse effect profile similar to, although milder than, oral corticosteroids has emerged. The most serious potential adverse effect is adrenal insufficiency, which can be life threatening. Adrenal insufficiency occurs most in patients taking the highest doses of ICSs but is reported with moderate or even low doses as well. Our recommendations include greater vigilance in testing adrenal function than current standard practice. In patients with diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2), an increase in glucose levels is likely, and diabetes medication adjustment may be needed when initiating or increasing ICSs. The risk of linear growth attenuation and adverse effects on bone mineral density is generally low but should be considered in the face of additional risk factors. On behalf of the Pediatric Endocrine Society Drugs and Therapeutics Committee, we present a review of the endocrine adverse effects of ICSs in children and offer recommendations relating to testing and referral. Limited data in particular realms diminish the strength of certain recommendations, and clinical judgment continues to be paramount.

Dose and Formulation Effects of ICSs Primary Conclusions Clinical effectiveness and systemic absorption have a strong posi- tive correlation that can only be partially addressed by device and formulation modifications (level of evidence 1). Primary Recommendations Device advancements have reduced local adverse effects. How- ever, reducing the systemic adverse effects of ICSs may require in- creasing protein binding and rapid clearance time and decreased lipophilicity (grade of recommendation A). Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics vary among ICS formulations. This is a result of differences in oral bioavailability, glucocorticoid receptor affinity, variable deposition in the lung, volumes of distribution, lipophilic qualities, rates of clearance, and modes of delivery.1,3 There are a variety of ICS delivery devices, including metered- dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers; metered-dose in- halers are often used with spacer devices that reduce oral deposi- tion and increase lung delivery. Oral deposition and lung delivery are also affected by particle size, with smaller particles having less oral and greater lung deposition.4 Local adverse effects, such as candidiasis, dysphonia, pharyngitis, and cough, are minimized with proper inha- lation technique and postinhalation oropharyngeal rinsing. Com- pounds with a high rate of first-pass metabolism have less systemic drug effect from oral deposition than those with lower rates.5 The clinically efficacious ICS deposited in the lung is also the main source for systemic absorption5,6; therefore, improved lung deliv- ery of ICS actually increases the risk of endocrine adverse effects. Although the shift from chlorofluorocarbons to hydrofluoroalkane allows smaller particle sizes and better lung delivery for many com- pounds, it can also result in greater systemic absorption.7 There are variable degrees of cortisol suppression or systemic bioavailability among delivery devices8-10; however, for most ICSs, respiratory effectiveness correlates with systemic bioavailability. De- vices that result in greater lung deposition should thus be used at lower doses. Postulation regarding the effect of discrepant in- tralung absorption has arisen, for example, whether there is greater systemic absorption from alveoli than bronchi, but data in this area are lacking.4 What appears clear, however, is that in healthy lungs or healthier asthmatic lungs, absorption is greater than in states of active disease and airflow obstruction, hence supporting clinical guidelines advocating step-down therapy for those who achieve asthma control.11,12 Compounds or metabolites that are more tightly bound to al- bumin and other proteins and less systemically active have fewer adverse effects, as do those cleared from the circulation more rap- idly. Although not well investigated, some experts13 assert that in- creased lipophilicity leads to greater systemic adverse effects be- cause of wider distribution and slower clearance, particularly in the case of fluticasone. Thus, although efforts to reduce oral deposi- tion have resulted in fewer local adverse effects, the effort to re- duce systemic adverse effects may ultimately need to focus on in- creasing protein binding, more rapid clearance, and decreasing lipophilicity. Binding and clearance data for commonly used ICSs are summarized in Table 1.14 The compound ciclesonide hydrofluoralkane14 is converted to a metabolite that has a high first-pass metabolism rate, is highly pro- tein bound, is rapidly cleared, and thus would be expected to de- liver clinical effect at the lungs while resulting in lower systemic con- sequence. However, experience with ciclesonide is not as long standing or as widespread as with fluticasone proprionate dry pow- der inhaler, and it took many years of clinical use for endocrine ad- verse effects of fluticasone to surface.13-15 Thus, although the phar- macodynamic profile of ciclesonide appears to be promising, cautious optimism is recommended. Effects on the HPA Axis Primary Conclusions The HPA axis suppression, although rare, is the most serious poten- tial ICS adverse effect and can occur even in children taking stan- dard dosages (level of evidence 1). At a Glance  Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are widely used as effective first-line treatment for various chronic respiratory illnesses. Although the long-term use of ICSs has a more favorable safety profile than that of oral corticosteroids, uncertainty about systemic complications persists.  With the advancement of devices and in drug pharmacokinetics, lung delivery and bioavailability of ICSs have improved, and an adverse effect profile similar to oral corticosteroids is emerging, albeit milder and with less frequency.  Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of ICSs. Adrenal function should be tested in symptomatic patients, those with growth attenuation, and high-risk asymptomatic patients.  Data on linear growth and bone mineral density (BMD) are generally reassuring, but height attainment should be carefully monitored, and testing for BMD should be considered in high-risk patients. Deteriorating blood glucose level control in patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2) (DM) is common with ICSs, and DM medication dose adjustments are likely required at the initiation of ICS treatment and with ICS dose increases.

Primary Recommendations Children taking ICSs with hypoglycemia or altered mental status should be urgently evaluated for adrenal insufficiency and treated, if necessary (grade of recommendation A). Children with growth fail- ure, anorexia, or weight loss should be tested for AI (grade of rec- ommendation B). Children taking high-dose ICSs or those requir- ing periodic oral corticosteroids treatment or additional long-term intranasal corticosteroid treatment, especially in conjunction with a low body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms di- vided by height in meters squared), should be tested routinely (grade of recommendation C). A testing algorithm is outlined in Table 2 and described in the text below. Stimulation testing interpretation is level of evidence 1b, as is making a diagnosis of AI from a morning cortisol level less than 3 g/dL in a symptomatic patient. Assurance of adrenal sufficiency in asymptomatic patients with a morning cortisol level greater than 10 g/dL is level of evidence 5, expert opinion. Thus, if suspicion is high, one should not rely solely on adequate morning cortisol values. It is well known that oral and injectable corticosteroids can re- sult in suppression of the HPA axis and with prolonged use can lead to adrenocortical atrophy. After the introduction of corticosteroids in the late 1940s to treat rheumatoid arthritis, reports of sudden deaths after surgery began to emerge.16 When ICSs were intro- duced for asthma control, HPA axis suppression was thought to be rare but still a consideration when used at high doses for a pro- longed period.17,18 Reassuring studies19,20 did not have evidence of AI at standard doses of ICSs. In a meta-analysis21 examining the adverse effects of ICSs, no evidence of AI with ICS doses at 400 g/d or less was found, re- gardless of the drug. At higher doses, the risk of AI was increased17,18,21 and common when growth suppression was also present.13,22 Since then, however, there have also been reports of AI occur- ring even at lower doses. Patel et al22 described 8 children who pre- sented with AI despite 7 of these children being prescribed a stan- dard recommended dose of ICS. Two presented with hypoglycemia, both without a history of abrupt cessation of ICS or illness; several children also had poor weight gain.13,22 In another case, a 7-year- old boy who presented in an acute adrenal crisis had been treated with fluticasone at a typically prescribed dose of 220 g/d for sev- eral years.13 As cases of AI associated with ICSs became increasingly re- ported, a survey was sent to pediatricians and endocrinologists in the United Kingdom to investigate the frequency of acute adrenal crises with ICS use.13 Thirty-three patients (28 children) were iden- tified: 23 patients presented with hypoglycemia, including 13 with decreased level of consciousness or coma and 9 with coma and sei- zures (1 with coma and seizure later died). Most cases involved high- dose ICSs that were still within recommended guidelines for se- vere persistent asthma.13 In a similar survey from France, 46 patients with AI were identified, of whom 18% were not receiving high- dose ICSs.23 It is important to acknowledge the lack of testing standardiza- tion across studies.24 In cases of secondary or central AI from exog- enous corticosteroid use, the adrenal cortex lags behind the pitu- itary gland in the recovery process.25 Therefore, although a basal Table 2.

Only 4 studies were identified.19,28-30 Using dynamic adrenal testing, those studies sought to determine the prevalence of HPA axis suppression in 26 children with asthma treated with ICSs and intranasal corticosteroids.31 With hypocortisolemia defined as a basal morn- ing cortisol level less than 3 g/dL, none of the children had a low basal cortisol level. However, metyrapone testing revealed that 35% had HPA axis suppression; this test is now difficult to perform be- cause of the unavailability of this agent. A larger study32 by the same group found that 6% had hypocortisolemia, the degree of biochemi- cal suppression can occur in up to two-thirds of children treated with corticosteroids, and suppression may even occur at low doses. An older study29 identified a morning ACTH level less than 11.7 pg/mL to correlate with AI on stimulation testing, but larger studies28,30,33,34 did not corroborate this finding. Concomitant nasal corticosteroid use, low BMI, and cumulative dose of ICS are contributing factors to the development of HPA axis suppression.31,32 Growth failure is a late finding and is not highly sen- sitive for detecting HPA axis suppression.30 Thus, practitioners should test most at-risk patients before growth failure occurs. However, when growth failure is detected, HPA axis function should be tested.22,35 Poor adherence to ICS treatment has a protective effect, likely due to partial recovery and incomplete suppression of the adrenal glands.32 However, poor adherence also likely conversely leads to poorer asthma control and additional oral corticosteroid doses. Our recommendations, as summarized in Table 2, include test- ing cortisol levels between 7 and 9 AM in all symptomatic patients not in crisis. If the morning cortisol level is less than 3 g/dL, a diag- nosis of AI is made. However, if the morning cortisol level is 3 g/dL or greater, an ACTH stimulation test is required. Symptoms of AI in patients taking ICSs are similar to those seen with other forms of ACTH insufficiency, including anorexia, weight loss, growth failure, and hypoglycemia; unique to these cases are possible signs of ap- parent corticosteroid excess, such as cushingoid features. Symptoms of adrenal crisis, such as hypotension, lethargy, and hypoglycemia, should provoke immediate testing, including a cor- tisol level in all cases and stimulation testing when possible. If the patient is unstable or ill appearing, treatment with stress doses of corticosteroids should be prompt while awaiting results. We also recommend testing in certain categories of asymptom- atic patients taking ICSs, including those taking high daily ICS doses or an ICS with other systemically absorbed corticosteroids, particu- larly patients with low BMI. The 10-g/dL threshold is acknowl- edged by our group as somewhat arbitrary; however, it is widely used in clinical practice by endocrinologists. Referral for stimulation tests on all at-risk patients is impractical. With this in mind, high-risk pa- tients should be monitored for symptoms of AI even with reassur- ing morning cortisol levels. We acknowledge that although the 1-g ACTH test is not defi- nitely superior to the standard 250-g ACTH stimulation test, it is generally regarded as more sensitive for secondary (central) HPA axis suppression.36 At a minimum, baseline and 30-minute cortisol val- ues should be measured, although sampling at more frequent in- tervals increases testing reliability (ie, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-minute samples).37 A peak cortisol level below 18 g/dL indicates AI.38 When HPA axis suppression from ICS use is detected in symp- tomatic patients, daily treatment with corticosteroids are required. In milder or asymptomatic cases, treatment may be needed only in the setting of illness or physical stress. All cases of HPA axis suppres- sion should be referred to an endocrinologist, and these patients should follow up closely with their pulmonologist or allergist for con- sideration of ICS dose reduction if safe, possibly by adding a cortico- steroid-sparing agent (ie, leukotriene receptor antagonists). Effects on Linear Growth Primary Conclusions In most patients, ICSs have minor and short-term effects on growth and very mild but potentially persistent long-term effects (level of evidence 2) (few studies followed through to final height attainment). Primary Recommendations The minor growth risks are outweighed by the respiratory benefits of ICSs (grade of recommendation B). Patients at higher risk in- clude those using additional growth-impairing medications (grade of recommendation D) (primarily based on expert opinion). Oral corticosteroids impair linear growth through suppression of growth hormone secretion, down-regulating the growth hor- mone receptor, reduction of IGF-1 concentration, and suppression of collagen synthesis at the growth plate.39 The effect of ICSs on linear growth has been evaluated via knemometry, a technique that measures the distance from the sur- face of the right flexed knee to the bottom of the sole and is a precise method of monitoring short-term growth.40-42 A placebo- controlled, crossover trial found a reduction in growth by 32% after 2 weeks of budesonide dry powder inhaler therapy.41 Similar meth- ods have been used to reveal growth reduction with short-term therapy with other ICSs, including fluticasone and beclomethasone dipropionate hydrofluoroalkane.42-44 Ciclesonide, thus far, has not been found to cause major growth impairment using knemometry.43 Intermediate-term investigations of the effect of ICSs on growth have found mild impairment. Using inhaled chlorofluorocarbon and beclomethasone dipropionate dry powder inhaler at 200 g twice daily, the Dutch Pediatric Asthma Study Group45 found a signifi- cant but small reduction in height (0.28 SD) in 1 year. A subse- quent study46 found that doubling the dose of chlorofluorocarbon- beclomethasone dipropionate dry powder inhaler (400 g twice daily) had a more significant effect on height (0.27 SD) than a stan- dard chlorofluorocarbon-beclomethasone dipropionate dry pow- der inhaler dose (200 g twice daily; 0.16 SD) for 1 year, and there was no added benefit. Of note, there was a disparity in the results at the same dose from the same group, perhaps highlighting the vari- able short-term effects of ICSs on growth. In a large, prospective, open-label study of both budesonide and fluticasone, Anthracopoulos et al47 found growth reduction in both groups in the first 6 to 12 months (0.08 SD), which was consistent with previous studies.48,49 However, patients heights returned to the baseline by 24 and 36 months.

Most long-term studies43,50,51 have found that adult heights in treated children and nontreated asth- matic control patients did not differ significantly. However, few studies52,53 have found a minor effect on final height of 1 cm. Effects on Bone Mineral Density Primary Conclusions Inhaled corticosteroids have mild effects on bone mineral density (BMD) that usually do not reach the threshold of clinical signifi- cance (level of evidence 2). Measures to ensure vitamin D suffi- ciency may ameliorate the negative BMD effects of ICSs (level of evidence 4). Primary Recommendations Routine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry screening in children tak- ing ICSs without other major risk factors is not indicated (grade of recommendation B). Measures to ensure vitamin D and calcium suf- ficiency are indicated and in lower-risk patients taking ICSs entail rou- tine vitamin D supplementation of 400 to 800 IU/d without moni- toring vitamin D levels in blood (grade of recommendation C). Several mechanisms impair both gastrointestinal absorption tract and renal tubular reabsorption of calcium, resulting in second- ary hyperparathyroidism.54 Furthermore, corticosteroids sup- press gonadotropin-releasing hormone and inhibit both growth hor- mone and IGF-1 secretion and growth hormone and IGF-1 axis action, synergistically reducing BMD. Of note, corticosteroid-induced bone mineral loss occurs mainly in trabecular bone, such as the spine.39 The threshold dose of ICSs for bone mineral loss has not been conclusively defined. Most pediatric studies55-58 evaluated the ef- fects of ICSs on lumbar spine BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorpti- ometry. A 2003 meta-analysis59 of 6 studies of adults included a total of 635 asthmatic patients using 4 different ICSs for at least 3 years. This analysis did not reveal a significant difference (4.1%, P = .80) in lumbar BMD in patients vs controls. Assessment of the effects of ICSs on BMD in children is con- founded by variable bone accretion associated with linear growth and age at entry into puberty.60 Several studies60-63 have looked at younger children to minimize the confounder of puberty. Three studies60-62 found no deleterious effects of standard doses of beclomethasone or fluticasone on BMD in children 12 years and younger. However, a study63 of 48 prepubertal children using high-dose beclomethasone or budesonide (mean [SD] dose, 670 [480] g/m2 daily) found a dose-dependent decrease of lumbar spine BMD accrual in 1 year in treated patients; of note, those tak- ing oral corticosteroids were not excluded, and the study did not calculate CIs. A study64 evaluating BMD in 37 adolescents (mean [SD] age, 13.6 [3.3] years) treated with high-dose fluticasone propionate (mean [SD] dose, 770 [250] g/m2 daily) for a mean (SD) of 2.9 (1.6) years revealed that lumbar BMD was more than 1 SD below the mean in 35% of treated patients compared with controls (P = .001). How- ever, when correcting for bone age, this value decreased to 16%, which was no longer statistically significant. Overall, children receiving high-dose ICSs are at risk for sub- stantially diminished BMD if they also have concomitant risk fac- tors, such as frequent oral corticosteroids, malnutrition, or chronic disease. There is some evidence that optimizing vitamin D in chil- dren taking ICSs can ameliorate this effect.55,65 Thus, although the role of routine monitoring and titration of vitamin D supplementa- tion is not yet established, our group considers it advisable for this group at highest risk. For those taking ICSs without a compounding risk, routine se- rum vitamin D level determination is not needed. Clinicians should be cognizant of adequate vitamin D intake, prophylactically pro- vide 400 to 800 IU/d of vitamin D, and ensure adequate dietary cal- cium of 1000 to 1300 mg/d.66 Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids on Glucose Metabolism Primary Conclusions The effects of ICSs on glucose levels are dose dependent. The effects of ICSs on glucose levels are primarily of concern in patients who have a previous diagnosis of DM or are at high risk of type 2 DM. These 2 conclusions are of evidence level 4 primarily because pediatric studies are limited. Data from adults in these areas are stronger. Primary Recommendations Patients with DM in whom ICSs are initiated or increased may require changes to their DM medication regimen. Patients at high risk of developing type 2 DM from obesity compounded by another risk factor, such as ethnicity and/or a positive family his- tory, should be tested after ICS treatment is initiated or increased. Testing for DM is generally recommended for this population regardless of whether they are taking ICSs (grade of recommenda- tion D). These recommendations are primarily regarded as expert opinion because pediatric studies are limited, although adult data are stronger. The metabolic effects of corticosteroids include decreased in- sulin sensitivity in several tissues.67 The decrease in insulin- stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is mediated through glucocorticoid-induced postreceptor effects.68 Corticosteroids also cause an increase in hepatic glucose production69 as reported by Pagano et al70; under the influence of treatment with high-dose glucocorticoid, there was an increase in hepatic glucose produc- tion evident in both the fasted and postprandial states. However, this glucogenic effect of corticosteroids could be overcome by high concentrations of insulin, whereas skeletal muscle glucose uptake was diminished. Therefore, peripheral insulin resistance appears to be the predominant mechanism leading to corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia. It has also been suggested that islet cell toxic ef- fects and apoptosis occur in patients exposed to corticosteroids.71 Furthermore, corticosteroids are known to inhibit insulin secretion by pancreatic -cells.72 Inhaled corticosteroids have been implicated in contributing to clinical hyperglycemia and DM. Most studies examining this effect have been conducted in adult populations. For example, a study69 performed in a large Veterans Affairs population sug- gested that, although ICSs were not associated with hyperglyce- mia in individuals without DM, among people with DM, ICS use was correlated with glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner.

Of note, a number of investigations75,76 have suggested that ICSs can induce insulin resistance among individuals without DM. A large epidemiologic study77 from Canada identified a 34% to 64% higher incidence of new-onset DM among those taking ICSs, as well as a 34% to 54% higher rate of progression to insulin use among patients with established DM taking ICSs, although the researchers did not ad- just for BMI. Both these studies established a dose-response asso- ciation between ICS and blood glucose levels, with daily doses in ex- cess of 1000 g of fluticasone propionate dry powder inhaler having the most pronounced effect. The only pediatric study78 to date examining glycemic effects of ICSs reported a small but statistically significant increase in he- moglobin A1c levels in children with asthma who were taking ICSs. However, the study failed to identify a dose-response association between ICSs and glucose levels. Furthermore, the only study79 to examine the effects of asthma treatment on children with preexist- ing DM contained an insufficient number treated with ICSs to draw meaningful conclusions. Our recommendations with regard to the effects of ICSs on glu- cose metabolism are summarized in Table 2. They include adjust- ing DM medications as needed when ICS use is initiated or ad- justed. For children without DM, our recommendations include testing those at risk because of obesity compounded by an addi- tional factor, such as high-risk ethnic group or family history of type 2 DM. Evidence about levels of fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c thresholds placing children into a higher DM risk category contin- ues to be a point of debate; however, our team has chosen a fasting glucose level of 100 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.0% based on available data.80,81 Conclusions Inhaled corticosteroids are generally safe, effective drugs, but adverse endocrine effects may occur. Although adverse effects and the thresh- olds defined as high dose by asthma guidelines do not precisely cor- relate, for the sake of clinical practice, high dose for any particular com- pound is similar to that defined by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.82 We summarize dosing guidelines in Table 3. We agree with the step-up and step-down approach put forth in these guidelines,82 meaning that patients with poor asthma control need an increase in dosing, followed by reductions in dosing when adequate asthma control is achieved. We do not recommend decreasing the ICS dose if it is deemed necessary to prevent pulmonary exacerbations and recurrent treatment with oral corticosteroids.
