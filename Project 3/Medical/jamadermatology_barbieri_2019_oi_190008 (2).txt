Use of Antibiotics for Dermatologic Procedures From 2008 to 2016 Use of Antibiotics for Dermatologic Procedures From 2008 to 2016 John S. Barbieri, MD, MBA; Jeremy R. Etzkorn, MD; David J. Margolis, MD, PhD IMPORTANCE Although overall antibiotic use among dermatologists is decreasing, there has been an increase in use associated with dermatologic procedures during the past decade. This higher antibiotic use may increase antibiotic-associated adverse events and promote the development of antibiotic resistance. OBJECTIVE To characterize antibiotic use associated with dermatologic procedures, including geographic variation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using Optum Clinformatics DataMart deidentified commercial claims data, we performed a repeated cross-sectional analysis of antibiotic prescribing by dermatologists from 2008 to 2016. Dermatology clinicians were identified by their National Uniform Claim Committee taxonomy codes, encounters for surgical procedures were identified by Common Procedure Terminology codes, and courses of oral antibiotics prescribed by these clinicians were identified by their National Drug Codes. EXPOSURES Claims for oral antibiotic prescriptions associated with encounters with dermatologists associated with dermatologic procedures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of antibiotic prescribing and associated procedures. Poisson regression models were used to assess for changes in the frequency of antibiotic prescribing over time. RESULTS Between 2008 and 2016, among 1 934 633 encounters (1 128 244 unique patients, 854 072 [44.1%] were women and the median [interquartile range] age was 66 [52-76] years) for dermatologic procedures, oral antibiotic prescribing associated with benign excisions increased from 2.9% to 4.4% of visits (52.5% relative change; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04), antibiotic prescribing associated with malignant excisions increased from 4.2% to 6.3% of visits (49.5% relative change; IRR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.06), and antibiotic prescribing associated with Mohs surgery increased from 9.9% to 13.8% of visits (39.7% relative change; IRR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04). There was greater than 2-fold variation in antibiotic prescribing rates across geographic census divisions. If higher prescribing divisions were to develop antibiotic prescribing rates similar to lower prescribing divisions, antibiotic use could be decreased by over 50%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Oral antibiotic prescribing by dermatologists associated with benign excisions, malignant excisions, and Mohs surgery is increasing over the past decade and there is substantial geographic variation. These findings highlight that there may be opportunities to optimize antibiotic use associated with dermatologic procedures.

Although use of oral an- tibiotics for chronic inflammatory conditions such as acne and rosacea appears to be decreasing, use of oral antibiotics associ- ated with dermatologic procedures has increased substantially over the past decade.10 In addition, a 2012 survey11 sent to Ameri- can College of Mohs Surgery members found that there may be antibiotic overuse associated with dermatologic procedures. However, factors associated with oral antibiotic use, differences in use between procedure types, and geographic variation in pre- scribing practices have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to further characterize the use of oral antibiot- ics associated with dermatologic procedures. Methods Study Design and Study Population This study was a repeated cross-sectional analysis using the OptumClinformaticsDataMartdatabasebetween2008and2016. Antibiotic prescriptions were associated with visits for surgical procedures as previously described.10 Procedures were classi- fied by their Current Procedural Terminology codes (eTable 1 in the Supplement).12 History of diabetes, solid organ transplant, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, joint re- placement, and artificial heart valve placement were determined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.13,14 This study was deemed exempt by the institutional re- view board of the University of Pennsylvania owing to the ret- rospective nature of the study and the deidentified data used. Statistical Analysis Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess for factors associated with antibiotic prescribing and multivari- able Poisson regression models were used to assess for changes in antibiotic prescribing over time. In addition, geographic varia- tion was assessed at the level of census division. Similar to prior studies on outpatient antibiotic use, comparisons between current prescribing levels and what could be achieved if high- prescribing regions were to prescribe at a rate similar to low- prescribing regions were used to assess for potential opportu- nities to reduce antibiotic use.15 Statistical analyses were performed in Stata statistical software (version 15, StataCorp). Results Cohort There were 1 934 633 encounters for surgical procedures dur- ing the study period among 1 128 244 unique patients (854 072 [44.1%] encounters involved female patients and the median [IQR] age was 66 [52-76] years) (Table 1) (eTable 2 in the Supple- ment). In 2016, antibiotics were prescribed for 1.2%, 4.4%, 6.3%, and 13.8% of visits for malignant destructions, benign excisions, malignant excisions, and Mohs surgery, respec- tively. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were cepha- lexin (64.6%), doxycycline (14.2%), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (6.1%). The median course duration was 7 days (IQR, 5-10 days). Factors Associated With Antibiotic Prescriptions Among those undergoing Mohs surgery, use of flaps (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.75-1.82) and use of grafts (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 2.16- 2.30) were associated with increased odds of antibiotic pre- scribing. In addition, female sex was associated with in- creased odds of antibiotic prescribing (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10). Older age was associated with decreased odds of antibiotic prescribing (Table 2). History of diabetes was asso- ciated with increased odds of antibiotic prescribing (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11). Temporal Trends in Antibiotic Use Between 2008 and 2016, overall antibiotic prescribing asso- ciated with malignant excisions increased from 4.2% to 6.3% of visits (49.5% relative change; IRR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.06). Overall antibiotic prescribing associated with Mohs surgery in- creased from 9.9% to 13.8% of visits (39.7% relative change; IRR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04). There was no significant change in antibiotic prescribing associated with malignant destruc- tions during this time period (Table 3) (Figure 1). Geographic Variation There was substantial geographic variation in antibiotic prescrib- ing (Figure 2) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Over the period from 2014to2016,formalignantexcisions,antibioticswereprescribed for 3.6% of visits in the lowest-utilizing division (West North Cen- tral) compared with 9.9% in the highest-utilizing division (West South Central) (2.76-fold variation). During this period, for Mohs surgery, antibiotics were prescribed for 7.6% of visits in the lowest-utilizing division (West North Central) compared with 16.9% in the highest-utilizing division (West South Central) (2.23- fold variation). These differences persisted after controlling for patient age, sex, comorbidities, and reconstructive factors Key Points Question How often are antibiotics prescribed for dermatologic procedures and how is this use changing over time? Findings In this repeated cross-sectional analysis of over 1 million unique patients, between 2008 and 2016, antibiotic prescribing increased from 2.9% to 4.4% of visits for benign excisions, from 4.2% to 6.3% of visits for malignant excisions, and from 9.9% to 13.8% of visits for Mohs surgery from 2008 to 2016. There was greater than 2-fold geographic variation in prescribing practices. Meaning Antibiotic use associated with dermatologic procedures is increasing and there is substantial geographic variation, suggesting there may be opportunities to optimize this antibiotic use.

If the highest-utilizing regions were to prescribe oral antibiotics at a rate similar to the lowest-utilizing region, that would result in a 57.6%, 53.6%, and 55.8% reduction in antibi- otic use associated with benign excisions, malignant excisions, and Mohs surgery, respectively. Discussion In this cross-sectional analysis, antibiotic prescribing by der- matologists associated with dermatologic procedures has in- creased considerably over the past decade across multiple pro- cedure types. Use of grafts followed by use of flaps were the 2 strongest factors associated with use of antibiotics for Mohs surgery, which is aligned with prior studies16-18 identifying that grafts and flaps are at increased risk of infection. Patients with a history of diabetes were also more likely to receive postop- erative antibiotics, which is consistent with evidence18,19 sug- gesting diabetes may be an independent risk factor for surgi- cal site infection for multiple procedure types. For both Mohs surgery and malignant excisions, women and younger patients had higher odds of receiving a prescription for postoperative antibiotics, although it is important to note the odds ratios are near 1 and the clinical significance of this effect may be small. Because prior studies20-22 have found that younger patients and female patients have higher concerns related to ap- pearance, surgeons may be more likely to prescribe antibiotics in these populations in an effort to prevent poor cosmetic out- comes owing to infectious complications. Although antibiotic prophylaxis may be helpful in certain settings, given the low overall risk of surgical site infections as- sociated with dermatologic procedures and the potential com- plicationsfromantibioticuse,currentpostoperativeantibioticpre- scribing practices may not be optimal for patient outcomes.16-18 Inaddition,theobservedgeographicvariationbetweenhigh-and low-utilizing regions, which persists after controlling for other patient risk factors, suggests that it may be possible to decrease oral antibiotic prescribing associated with benign excisions, ma- lignant excisions, and Mohs surgery by more than 50%.15 There also may be opportunities to decrease the duration of prophylaxis from the median duration of 7 days observed in this study. Guidelines recommend limited use of single-dose peri- operative antibiotics for the prevention of infective endocardi- tis and joint infections in high-risk patients.13,14,23 With respect to prevention of surgical site infections, studies of clean- contaminated outpatient procedures, including several random- ized clinical trials of surgical procedures on the head and neck, have not identified increased efficacy from longer antibiotic regimens.24-29 In addition, 1 study27 found rates of adverse ef- fects, including nausea (10% vs 0%), diarrhea (13% vs 0%), and skin rashes (5% vs 2%) were more common in the postoperative antibiotic group than the perioperative antibiotic-alone group. The results of these studies are reflected in the 2008 Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology Advisory State- ment on antibiotic prophylaxis,23 which recommends single- dose perioperative antibiotics for those at increased risk of surgical site infection. Although it may be challenging to have single-dose perioperative antibiotics readily available in derma- tologic clinics not associated with a pharmacy, using periopera- tive antibiotics alone or short postoperative courses may have similar efficacy and reduced rates of adverse effects compared with longer postoperative courses.27 Similar to the question of topical antibiotics for postoperative surgical site treatment, well controlled, prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal settings and duration of therapy for perioperative and postoperative oral antibiotics for dermatologic procedures.30 Limitations The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of the study design. Because perioperative antibiotics admin- istered in the office may not generate an associated pharmacy claim and because we are unable to link preoperative antibiot- ics prescribed at the time of consultation prior to the surgical appointment, we may be unable to fully capture in-office use of perioperative antibiotics. As a result, our results may Table 1.

In addition, the lack of site specificity in the Current Pro- cedural Terminology (CPT) codes for surgical procedures limits our ability to precisely evaluate for differences in antibi- otic use between different high-risk surgical sites. Conclusions Although overall oral antibiotic use among dermatologists is declining, antibiotic prescribing by dermatologists associ- ated with benign excisions, malignant excisions, and Mohs surgery has been increasing over the past decade and there is substantial geographic variation in antibiotic use.10 These prolonged courses of postoperative antibiotics may place patients at unnecessary risk of adverse outcomes without providing additional value with respect to prevention of postoperative complications. Given the substantial geo- graphic variation in practice patterns, there are likely oppor- tunities to optimize antibiotic use associated with dermato- logic procedures to improve patient outcomes. Additional clinical studies of the optimal use of perioperative and post- operative antibiotics for dermatologic procedures are needed to better inform clinical practice and guidelines.
