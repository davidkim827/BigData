We report that disease-associated prion pro- tein specifically inhibits the proteolytic b sub- units of the 26S proteasome. Using reporter substrates, fluorogenic peptides, and an activ- ity probe for the b subunits, this inhibitory effect was demonstrated in pure 26S proteasome and three different cell lines. By challenge with re- combinant prion and other amyloidogenic pro- teins, we demonstrate that only the prion protein in a nonnative b sheet conformation in- hibits the 26S proteasome at stoichiometric concentrations. Preincubation with an antibody specific for aggregation intermediates abro- gates this inhibition, consistent with an oligo- meric species mediating this effect. We also present evidence for a direct relationship be- tween prion neuropathology and impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in prion-infected UPS-reporter mice. Together, these data suggest a mechanism for intracellu- lar neurotoxicity mediated by oligomers of mis- folded prion protein. INTRODUCTION Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders whose pathogenesis is associated with a conformational rearrangement of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) to abnormal conformers (PrPSc) (Prusiner, 1982). PrPC is soluble, monomeric, and rich in a-helical structure, whereas the disease-associated PrPSc is characterized Mo by increased b sheet structure, detergent insolubility, and partial resistance to proteolysis. Neuropathologically, prion diseases are characterized by severe neuronal loss, marked gliosis, and spongiform change and accumula- tion of PrPSc in the brain. However, the cause of prion- mediated neurodegeneration is not known, and a major gap exists in the understanding of how the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc ultimately kills neurons. It is known that PrPC is essential for the development of prion disease (Bueler et al., 1993). However, loss of function of PrPC is unlikely to be the cause of prion-mediated pathology be- cause neither embryonic (Bueler et al., 1993) nor adult knockout (Mallucci et al., 2002) of PrPC results in neurode- generation. Hence, an unknown toxic gain of function of PrPSc or its precursor is more likely to underlie this charac- teristic pathology. There is increasing evidence that intracellular PrPSc ac- cumulation in neurons may be necessary to cause toxicity. First, neurons that do not express PrPC, and therefore cannot produce PrPSc, remain healthy and free of pathol- ogy (Brandner et al., 1996; Mallucci et al., 2003). Second, prion-infected transgenic mice expressing PrP lacking its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor produced infec- tious prions and accumulated PrP amyloid plaques in their brains but did not succumb to clinical disease (Chesebro et al., 2005). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain neuronal death in prion disease (Caughey and Baron, 2006; Harris and True, 2006). In vitro studies have sug- gested that both full-length PrPSc (Hetz et al., 2003) and shorter peptide fragments (Forloni et al., 1993) are toxic when applied to primary neurons. Other mechanisms sug- gested relate to altered PrPC trafficking. It has been de- scribed that PrPC may assume a transmembrane topology (CtmPrP), which has been suggested to correlate with neu- rotoxicity (Hegde et al., 1998). It has been proposed that toxicity involves altered trafficking of PrPC, where inhibi- tion of the UPS results in cytosolic PrPC accumulation and cell death (Ma and Lindquist, 2002).

Suffix 18 denotes cells cured of prion infection. n = 10  SEM. work has suggested a clear role for UPS dysfunction in the pathogenesis of prion disease. We found that neuronal propagation of prions in the presence of mild proteasome impairment invoked a neurotoxic mechanism involving the intracellular formation of cytosolic PrPSc aggresomes that triggered caspase-dependent neuronal apoptosis with evidence for similar structures in vivo in brains of prion- infected mice (Kristiansen et al., 2005). Degradation of intracellular proteins via the UPS is a complex and tightly regulated process that plays a criti- cal role in a variety of cellular processes (Goldberg, 2003). The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent complex that consists of a 20S proteolytic core complexed at one or both ends with a 19S regulatory complex (Goldberg, 2003). The 20S proteasome is a hollow, barrel-shaped protein complex composed of 14 a and 14 b subunits arranged in four stacked rings with an overall architecture of a(17)b(17)b(17)a(17) (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998). The two outer a rings form gated channels through which substrates enter and products exit the catalytic core. The proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome re- sides in the two inner b rings. The proteasome has three distinct catalytic activities, each of which can be corre- lated to the action of an individual b subunit. These are termed b1 (caspase-like), b2 (trypsin-like), and b5 (chymo- trypsin-like), and the secondary alcohol of the N-terminal threonine of the active b subunit acts as the nucleophilic species (Voges et al., 1999). By recognizing and selec- tively degrading misfolded and damaged proteins, the UPS protects cells against the potentially toxic effects of protein aggregation. Aberrations in this system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons dis- ease, Alzheimers disease, and Huntingtons disease (HD) (Ciechanover and Brundin, 2003). The proteasome cannot efficiently degrade aggregated protein (Verhoef et al., 2002), and protein aggregates have been shown to actually impair the functional capacity of the UPS in cell models (Bence et al., 2001). Currently, the role of the UPS in these neurodegenerative diseases is debated. In a spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) mouse model, polyglut- amine pathogenesis occurred in the absence of significant proteasome impairment (Bowman et al., 2005); in an HD 176 Molecular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier mouse model, there was no detectable impairment of pro- teasome function (Bett et al., 2006). An alternative route for cellular protein clearance is via autophagy, and data suggest that many aggregation-prone proteins can also be cleared via this mechanism (Rubinsztein, 2006). The aims of this study were to examine further the nature of the PrP species responsible for neurotoxicity, to evaluate the role of the UPS in prion disease pathogen- esis, and to investigate whether there was a direct mech- anistic link between the two. We have shown in vitro that purified PrPSc preparations impair neuronal cellular func- tion by inhibiting the catalytic core b subunits of the 26S proteasome; a recombinant aggregated b sheet-rich pro- tein that shares many physico-chemical properties with PrPSc, designated b-PrP (Jackson et al., 1999b), has a sim- ilar effect at stoichiometric concentrations. Preincubation with an antibody specific for small aggregation intermedi- ates abrogates this inhibition, consistent with the hypoth- esis that a small oligomeric PrP species mediates this effect. We also present in vivo evidence for a direct rela- tionship between prion neuropathology and proteasome inhibition by using a reporter mouse model for the UPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported in vivo evidence for functional proteasome impairment in a neurodegenerative disease characterized by protein aggregation. These data together suggest a mechanism for intracellular prion-mediated neurotoxicity. RESULTS Prion Infection Impairs the Proteolytic Activity of the 26S Proteasome Mouse hypothalamic neuronal GT-1 (Schatzl et al., 1997) and neuroblastoma N2aPK-1 cells (Klohn et al., 2003) were infected with either RML prion-infected or mock- infected CD-1 mouse brain homogenate (Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like proteo- lytic activities were measured in prion-infected, mock- infected, and wild-type GT-1 and N2aPK-1 cells. Signifi- cant loss of chymotrypsin-like (38%) and caspase-like activity (37%) was seen in ScGT-1 cells (Figure 1) and Inc. Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function also in ScN2aPK-1 cells (data not shown). Assays in the absence of ATP showed no activity, confirming measure- ment of proteolytic activity of the ATP-dependent 26S proteasome (Figure 1). Normal proteolytic activities were seen in mock-infected cells and cells cured of prion infec- tion by using anti-PrP monoclonal antibody treatment (Figure 1). Measurement of proteasome activity in RML- prion-infected CD-1 mouse brain (Figure S1B) demon- strated significant loss of chymotrypsin-like and caspase- like activity (Figure S1C). Immunoblotting for proteasome subunits revealed no loss of subunits, indicating that loss of proteolytic activity results from an inhibitory effect (Figure S1D). However, assaying proteasomal function from prion-infected brain is complicated by the presence of the marked glial proliferation characteristic of prion neu- ropathology, which may result in overestimation of proteo- lytic function. Therefore, we studied proteasome reporter mice inoculated with prions (see below). In summary, prion infection results in loss of the chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like proteolytic activities in two different neuronal cell lines and prion-infected mouse brain. Cytosolic Localization of PrPSc in Prion-Infected Cells Because the proteasome is localized in the nucleus and cytosol of cells, we probed whether PrPSc accesses the cytosol in prion-infected cells. Due to the lack of PrPSc- specific antibodies, the subcellular distribution of PrPSc is difficult to assess. Studies support localization at the plasma membrane and in the endolysosomal compart- ment (Caughey and Baron, 2006). Using formic acid (FA) pretreatment to remove all PrPC (Kristiansen et al., 2005), we show PrPSc on the cell surface and intracellu- larly in ScN2aPK-1 cells (Figure S2A). Dual-labeled immu- nostaining shows PrPSc partially colocalized with the endolysosomal marker LAMP-1, but it also exists outside this compartment (Figure 2A). We also show that a propor- tion of FA-resistant PrPSc colocalizes with the cytosolic marker Hsc70 (Figure 2B). An intensity scatter plot and subtraction image (Figure S2B) reveals true colocali- zation between Hsc70 and PrPSc. The presence of a pro- portion of cytosolic PrPSc is supported by our previous data describing neurotoxic cytosolic PrPSc aggresomes (Kristiansen et al., 2005). These data show a limited amount of PrPSc is present in the cytosol in prion-infected cells. Prion Infection Results in Malfunction of the Intact Proteasome in Live Cells To test whether the proteolytic dysfunction observed in prion-infected neuronal cells resulted in functional impair- ment of the UPS in live cells, we infected an N2aPK-1 cell line stably expressing the fluorescent proteasome reporter substrate UbG76V-GFP (Dantuma et al., 2000) with prions. Prion infection caused an increase in the steady-state levels of the reporter indicative of functional impairment of the UPS (Figure 2C). Curing cells of prion infection resulted in normal UPS function (Figure 2C). Mole We followed the ability of cells to clear the reporter that had been accumulated by incubation with a reversible proteasome inhibitor. Prion-infected cells took signifi- cantly longer to clear the reporter than uninfected cells (Figure 2D). The rate of degradation at 1 hr was 42% less in prion-infected cells (Figure S3A). Using cyclohexi- mide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, still resulted in a delay in degradation of the reporter, indicating impaired proteolytic function (Figure S3B). PrPSc and Aggregated Recombinant b-PrP Inhibit Proteolysis by the 26S Proteasome To investigate a possible role for PrP species in UPS inhi- bition, we developed an in vitro assay system to measure the effects of different conformations and aggregation states of PrP on 26S proteasome activity, both in pure form and in neuronal cell lysates. Recombinant mouse PrP (aa 23231) was used folded into either an a-helical structure representative of native PrPC (a-PrP) or a pre- dominantly b sheet species termed b-PrP (Jackson et al., 1999b). We have previously shown that b-PrP has similar physico-chemical properties to PrPSc (Jackson et al., 1999b). We made five different PrP species: aggre- gated a-PrP, aggregated b-PrP, which forms small, spher- ical particles 510 nm in diameter (Jackson et al., 1999b), acidified a-PrP-derived amyloid fibrils (Baskakov et al., 2002), and NaCl-treated a-PrP. We also studied semipuri- fied PrPSc from RML-infected CD-1 mouse brain and ScGT-1 cells (Kristiansen et al., 2005). In pure 26S proteasome assays, only aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc caused a significant reduction in chymotrypsin- like (Figure 3Aa; b-PrP, 56% loss; PrPSc, 42%) and cas- pase-like activity (Figure 3Ab; b-PrP, 56%; PrPSc, 47%). They had a lesser but still significant effect on trypsin- like activity (Figure 3Ac). None of the other PrP species above had any inhibitory effect on proteolytic activity (Fig- ures 3Aa3Ac). We assayed 26S proteasome activity in lysates from GT-1, N2aPK-1 cells, and in primary cerebel- lar granule neurons (CGNs). Only aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc, but not the other prion species, caused a significant reduction in chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activity in these three different cell lysates (Figures S4A and S4B and data not shown). This pattern of b subunit proteolytic inhi- bition is the same as that seen in prion-infected cells and mouse brain. Prion Infection Impairs the Proteasome by Specifically Inhibiting the Catalytic b Subunit Activity To investigate the UPS b subunit inhibition by prions, we used specific b subunit activity probes (Berkers et al., 2005). These are cell-permeant peptide vinyl sulfone- based inhibitors that modify the catalytically active threo- nine residues of the b subunits, forming a covalent b-sul- fonyl ether linkage. Cell lysates from ScN2aPK-1 cells were incubated with the activity probe and immunoblotted with an anti-dansyl antibody. Modification of b subunit activities (indicating a loss of activity) was clearly seen in ScN2aPK-1 cells compared to uninfected, mock-infected, cular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 177 Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function Figure 2.

Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function and cured cells (Figure 3B). As these b subunit activity probes are cell permeant, we also assayed them in live GT-1 cells. Loss of b subunit activity was seen only in ScGT-1 cells (Figure S5A). PrPSc and Aggregated Recombinant b-PrP Inhibit the Catalytic b Subunit Activity of the Proteasome Both aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc inhibit the b subunit ac- tivities (Figure 3C), with a-PrP, aggregated a-PrP, and am- yloid fibrils having no inhibitory effect (Figure 3C). We also found that reduced carboxy-methylated a-lactalbumin had no inhibitory effect (Figure 3C); this is a soluble unfolded protein molecule used in protein folding studies as a mimetic of the molten globule state (Kuwajima, 1996). PrPSc derived from RML prion-infected mouse brain also had marked inhibition on b subunit activities (Fig- ure 3D). We also incubated cytosolic fractions from mouse CGN cultures with the different PrP species and assessed b subunit activity. b-PrP and PrPSc cause a loss of b subunit (predominantly b1 and b5) activities in CGNs (Figure 3E). Denaturation of b-PrP and PrPSc Abolishes Their Inhibitory Effect on b Subunit Activity Denaturation of b-PrP and PrPSc by serial freeze-boiling completely removed their inhibitory activity (Figure 3F). Inhibition of the b subunit activities is restored after denaturation, indicating that a specific conformation of the inhibitory species in b-PrP and PrPSc is necessary for inhibition of the catalytic b subunits. Nonaggregated b-PrP had no effect on proteolytic activities (Figure 3G). b-PrP is a Highly Potent Inhibitor of 26S Proteasome b Subunit Proteolysis To determine the potency of b-PrP in inhibiting the 26S b subunit activities, serial dilutions of aggregated b-PrP were prepared and incubated with cytosolic cell fractions prior to assaying b subunit activity. Proteolytic b subunit activity is restored to normal levels at 50 ng/ml of b-PrP (Figure S5B). To gain insight into the molar ratio of aggre- gated b-PrP required to inhibit the proteasome, we as- sayed known concentrations of pure 26S proteasome with aggregated b-PrP. The molar ratio of b-PrP that in- hibits 26S proteasome is essentially stoichiometric; 100 ng final concentration (fc) 26S (1.39 nM) required 1.5 ng b-PrP (2.15nM) to inhibit (Figure 4A), 300 ng fc 26S (4.16 nM) required 3 ng b-PrP (4.3 nM) to inhibit (Figure 4B), and 900 ng fc 26S (12.49 nM) required 7.5 ng (10.75 nM) b-PrP to inhibit (Figure 4C). Data and calculations are sum- marized in Figure S5C. These data demonstrate that this PrP species is a highly potent inhibitor of b subunit proteo- lytic activity and suggest that it is likely to be a very small aggregated oligomeric PrP species that is inhibitory. Preincubation with an Anti-Oligomer Antibody Abrogates the Inhibition of the b Subunit Activity by b-PrP and PrPSc To investigate whether an oligomeric species of PrP was re- sponsible for inhibition of b subunit activity, we assessed Mole whether an anti-oligomer antibody (Kayed et al., 2003) could prevent this inhibitory effect. Preincubation of either 0.5 mg/ml aggregated b-PrP or PrPSc preparation (Fig- ure 5Aa) with molar excess of anti-oligomer antibody (150 mg/ml) abolished their inhibitory effect on the b subunits (Figure 5Aa). The specificity of the effect was confirmed by preincubating both b-PrP and PrPSc with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against b-actin, which had no effect (Figure 5Aa). We also preincubated both PrPSc and aggregated b-PrP with the same concentration (150 mg/ml) of three anti-PrP antibodies raised against different regions of the prion protein that did not diminish the inhibitory effect of PrPSc or aggregated b-PrP (Figures 5Ab and 5Ac), confirming the specificity of the action of the anti-oligomer antibody. These data are consistent with an oligomeric PrP species in b-PrP and PrPSc inhibiting the 26S b subunit activity. Inhibition of the Proteasome Is Specific to Conformational Isoforms of PrP To determine if the inhibitory effect was specific to PrPSc and PrPSc-like species, we assessed the effects of other nonprion recombinant aggregated proteins on the b sub- unit activities. Ab140 amyloid fibrils, SOD1 mutant protein (G37R), and lysozyme amyloid fibrils were studied. The in- hibitory effect on the 26S b subunits is specific to aggre- gated conformational isoforms of PrP as none of the other proteins assayed had any inhibitory effect (Figure 5B). Only the presence of aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc had a significant inhibitory effect on chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activity in pure 26S proteasome (Figure 5C) and our three different cell lines (Figures S6 and S7). Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit the 20S Proteasome Catalytic Core, but Not via Dissociation of the 26S Proteasome Dissociation of the 26S proteasome into the 20S core par- ticle and 19S regulatory particle causes inhibition of prote- olysis (Elsasser et al., 2005). To probe whether our data could be explained by PrP causing dissociation of the 26S proteasome and inhibiting its activity, we used native gels to assess the effect of aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc on native 26S proteasome. Native PAGE using 19S and 20S antibodies shows that aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc do not cause dissociation of the 26S proteasome (Figure 6A). This was confirmed by native gel activity stain- ing (Figure 6B) using the fluorogenic substrate overlay for chymotrypsin activity. Both aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc significantly inhibit chymotrypsin activity in native 26S proteasome compared to untreated 26S (Figure 6B). Coo- massie staining confirmed equal protein loading (Fig- ure S8A). Native PAGE of ScGT-1 cells and prion-infected mouse brain demonstrates that there is no dissociation of the 26S proteasome (Figure S8B). We tested whether oligomeric PrP species could affect the 20S proteasome core particle independent of the 19S regulatory cap. We substituted the 19S regulatory particle with the PA28 activator (Whitby et al., 2000), which acti- vates the proteasome core particle but does not mediate cular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 179 Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function Figure 3.

(G) Only b-PrP in an aggregated state inhibited b subunit activities (lane 2) in N2aPK-1 cell lysates. 180 Molecular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and many other activities mediated by the 19S regulator particle (Voges et al., 1999). Assaying PA28-activated 20S showed that aggregated b-PrP and PrPSc significantly inhibited chymotrypsin-like (Figure 6Ca) and caspase-like activity (Figure 6Cb) with a lesser effect on trypsin activity (Figure 6Cc). This again is the same pattern of inhibition as seen with pure 26S pro- teasome (Figure 3A), but with a less profound inhibitory effect. These data strongly suggest that the oligomeric inhibitory PrP species exert their effect directly on the 20S particle independent of the 19S complex. Prion Infection Causes Specific Inhibition of the UPS in GFP-Proteasome Reporter Transgenic Mice In Vivo To assess whether UPS impairment also occurred in prion-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo, we studied a transgenic mouse model that allows the functional sta- tus of the UPS to be monitored (Lindsten et al., 2003). These mice express the UbG76V-GFP reporter under the control of the CMV-immediate early enhancer and the chicken b-actin promoter with constitutive and ubiq- uitous expression throughout the body, including the brain. Accumulation of UbG76V-GFP occurred only in the 22L prion-infected transgenic mouse brains and Figure 4. b-PrP Is a Highly Potent Inhibitor of 26S Proteasome b Subunit Proteolysis To determine potency of aggregated b-PrP in inhibiting the 26S pro- teolytic activity, serial dilutions of aggregated b-PrP were preincu- bated with three different concentrations of 26S proteasome before incubation with the b subunit activity probe. (A) 100 ng final concentra- tion of 26S proteasome required 1.5 ng aggregated b-PrP to inhibit b subunit proteolysis, (B) 300 ng final concentration of 26S proteasome required 3 ng aggregated b-PrP to inhibit b subunit proteolysis, and (C) 900 ng final concentration of 26S proteasome required 7.5 ng aggre- gated b-PrP to inhibit b subunit proteolysis. Mol was seen in regions of the brain with the most intense neuropathology, consisting of spongiosis, gliosis, and PrPSc deposition (Figure 7A). Similar results were ob- tained with the two available reporter mouse strains es- tablished from different founders (Lindsten et al., 2003). Quantitative PCR confirmed that the accumulation of UbG76V-GFP was not due to transcriptional upregulation (Figure S9). There was no UbG76V-GFP accumulation in mice inoculated with normal brain or in 22L prion- infected nontransgenic littermates (Figure 7A). In the brains of the 22L prion-infected UbG76V-GFP mice, we found accumulation of intraneuronal cytoplasmic, granu- lar, ubiquitinated deposits (Figure 7B). These were occa- sionally observed in the control mice but only at very low levels (Figure 7B). The expression of the UbG76V-GFP transgene appeared to have no detectable effect on the deposition of ubiquitinated proteins (Figure 7B). These data suggest that prion disease in vivo is asso- ciated with UPS dysfunction and support the in vitro studies indicating that proteasome function is directly compromised by the presence of PrPSc or its synthetic mimetic b-PrP. DISCUSSION While prion infection causes widespread neuronal loss in the brain, the molecular basis of prion neurotoxicity is un- known. Neurodegeneration cannot be explained by a loss of functional PrPC, as its depletion does not trigger any gross pathology. The alternative explanation, that PrPSc it- self is neurotoxic, does not adequately describe findings where neurons can be in close proximity to PrPSc deposits without suffering deleterious effects, providing those cells do not express cell-surface PrPC. It has been suggested that PrPSc interacts with cell-surface PrPC, which results in apoptosis through aberrant signaling cascades (Solfor- osi et al., 2004). An alternative explanation is that intra- cellular accumulation of disease-associated PrP is re- quired for cytotoxicity. Here, we present both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence for a potential neuro- toxic mechanism mediated by specific misfolded forms of PrP that would explain the lack of direct toxicity from extracellular PrPSc. We also demonstrate in vivo functional impairment of the UPS in a neurodegenerative disease. We have established that oligomeric nonnative forms of PrP inhibit the activity of the catalytic b subunits of the 26S proteasome and that this occurs at stoichiometric concentrations. Using fluorogenic peptide assays and b subunit activity probes, we demonstrated in two prion-infected neuronal cell lines that the presence of misfolded PrP significantly inhibits the chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities; this finding was mirrored in RML prion-infected CD-1 mouse brain. This supports previous work where impair- ment of these activities has been shown in mouse brain infected with a different prion strain (Kang et al., 2004). In- activation of the chymotrypsin-like sites causes significant inhibition of protein degradation (Chen and Hochstrasser, ecular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 181 Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function Figure 5.

This was abrogated by curing the cells of prion infec- tion, demonstrating a direct link between prion infection and UPS impairment in live cells. These cells only propa- gate low levels of PrPSc, which is relatively sensitive to PK digestion, and by inference clearance. This is likely to be a unique feature that allows them to propagate prions without obvious cytotoxicity (Weissmann, 2004), and thus, they are able to tolerate this level of UPS dysfunc- tion. When their UPS becomes further impaired they rap- idly undergo apoptosis (Kristiansen et al., 2005). In an in vitro assay system we developed, we show that PrPSc and aggregated b-PrP, but not recombinant PrPC or PrP amyloid fibrils, inhibited proteolysis by the 26S pro- teasome. The sequence and conformational specificity of the inhibitory effect was tested by measuring the effects of Ab140 amyloid fibrils, SOD1 G37R mutant protein, ag- gregated lysozyme, and a-lactalbumin, all of which had no effect. Moreover, conformational disruption of PrPSc and b-PrP abolished their inhibitory properties, demon- strating that the effect depends on a specific conformation and aggregation state. Dose-response analysis showed that inhibition of the catalytic activity of the 26S proteasome by b-PrP occurred Mole at a low stoichiometry. However, because the proportion of active 26S proteasome complexes in the preparation is unknown, it is impossible to determine the true molecu- lar stoichiometry for the inhibited proteasome species. We have previously argued, based on observations in subclin- ical models of prion infection, that prion neurotoxicity may relate not to PrPSc (or prions) but to critical levels of a toxic oligomeric species produced during prion propagation (designated PrPL with L for lethal) (Hill and Collinge, 2003). Our current data are supportive of this, and it is also apparent from these data that the affinity of PrPL for the proteasome is extremely high. To investigate this fur- ther, we used an antibody that reacts with oligomeric, but not monomeric or fibrillar, forms of amyloidogenic pro- teins. Preincubation with this antibody completely abol- ished any inhibitory effect on the catalytic b subunits, suggesting that an oligomeric PrP species may be respon- sible for the inhibition of the 26S proteasome. Together, our data support an inhibitory effect of oligo- meric PrP species on the 20S complex itself, and the dif- ferential inhibitory effect of prions on the caspase-like (b1) and chymotrypsin-like (b5) proteolytic activities versus the minor effect on the trypsin-like activity (b2) can be ex- plained by two possible mechanisms. The first is that olig- omeric PrP species have a direct inhibitory effect on the b1 cular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 183 Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function Figure 7. Prion Infection Causes Specific Inhibition of the UPS in GFP-Proteasome Reporter Transgenic Mice with Accumulation of Ubiquitin Deposits (A) Immunohistochemical studies of UbG76V-GFP+/ transgenic mice inoculated intracerebrally with the 22L strain of mouse scrapie (UbG76V- GFP+//22L) (top) or normal brain homogenate (UbG76V-GFP +//NL) (middle) and UbG76V-GFP/ inoculated with 22L (UbG76V-GFP//22L) (bot- tom). Left panels show low-power views of saggital sections through the hippocampus (H), third ventricle (V), and thalamus (T) stained with anti-PrP antiserum R30. Other panels show high-power views of the thalamus stained for PrP, GFAP, and UbG76V-GFP. The 22L-inoculated mice exhibited pri- marily diffuse staining for PrP and extensive astrocytosis (black arrows point to hypertrophic astrocytes). Collections of UbG76V-GFP + cells were seen in the 22L inoculated UbG76V-GFP+/mice (open arrows). The specificity of the anti-UbG76V-GFP antiserum is demonstrated by the lack of staining of these cells in the 22L inoculated UbG76V-GFP/mice. (B) Immunohistochemical staining for ubiquitin in sections of thalamus from UbG76V-GFP+/mice inoculated with 22L prion strain or normal brain ho- mogenate. Granular deposits of ubiquitin are seen scattered throughout the sections of the 22L-infected brain but were rarely observed in the control. Arrows point to large neuron-like cells containing ubiquitin deposits that exhibit a perinuclear localization. The lower panel of a UbG76V-GFP/ inoculated with 22L demonstrates that the expression of the transgene appeared to have no effect on the deposition of ubiquitinated proteins. The substrate for all antisera was amino-ethyl-carbazol yielding a red product. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. and b5 proteolytic active sites of the 20S core. However, the diameter of the gated channel is 2 nm (Pickart and Cohen, 2004), and if the inhibitory PrP species is an oligo- mer, it cannot traverse the gate intact and enter the cata- lytic chamber. The only possibility of direct inhibition is that the PrP unfolds and threads into the chamber. The second mechanism is that prions inhibit gate opening of the 20S proteasome. Entry of substrates into the catalytic chamber of the 20S is regulated by opening of the gated channel, which is normally held closed by the N-terminal tails of the outer a ring subunits (Groll et al., 2000; Whitby et al., 2000). Studies of gate opening with addition of hydrophobic peptides, use of PA28 activator, or gate de- 184 Molecular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier I letion (which all accelerate substrate entry) stimulate cleavage at the chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like sites by enhancing their Vmax but do not stimulate the slower cleavage at the trypsin-like site (Prof. A. Goldberg, Har- vard University, personal communication; Kisselev et al., 2002). Therefore, an inhibitory effect of prions on gate opening of the 20S proteasome would have a more severe inhibitory effect on the chymotrypsin-like and caspase- like activities rather than the trypsin-like sitean effect we clearly see in our data. The levels of proteasome inhi- bition observed (>50% loss in each caspase-like and chy- motrypsin-like activity) are likely to have serious conse- quences for neuronal viability, as inhibition of these two nc. Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function of the 20S catalytic sites have additive effects in reducing protein degradation (Kisselev et al., 2006). The degrada- tive capacity of the UPS is also known to decline during the aging process (Lee et al., 2000), and combined with the effects of neuronal stress in the brain, this will further incapacitate UPS function, resulting in neuronal dysfunc- tion (Sherman and Goldberg, 2001). Therefore to ascertain whether our in vitro data had in vivo relevance, and importantly whether prions were ex- erting a similar inhibitory effect on the UPS in vivo, we stud- ied proteasome reporter mice. These mice enable in vivo testing of the role of the UPS in neurodegeneration; they have been used to demonstrate that proteasome impair- ment does not contribute to pathogenesis in an SCA7 mouse model (Bowman et al., 2005). Their data also show that neuronal apoptosis per se does not cause accu- mulation of the reporter, which is only seen when there is significant UPS dysfunction. Accumulation of the UbG76V- GFP reporter occurred only in our prion-infected mice brains. Intracellular accumulation of the GFP reporter was associated with neuronal loss and PrPSc deposition, indi- cating a relationship between UPS dysfunction and prion- mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. In the brains of prion- infected GFP-reporter mice, we also found accumulation of intracellular cytosolic granular ubiquitinated deposits, which are likely to represent cytosolic ubiquitinated-protein conjugates that accumulate as they are not degraded by the failing proteasome. Interestingly, similar ubiquitin-pro- tein conjugates within neurons were reported in the brains of prion-infected mice (Lowe et al., 1992). They found that these intracellular ubiquitinated deposits were seen early in the course of the incubation time when mice were pre- symptomatic, and increased with disease progression. They noted that the pathological accumulation of the intra- cellular ubiquitin-protein structures corresponded tem- porally with the earliest detection of PrPSc (Lowe et al., 1992). These observations can now be explained by our data. Although proteasome impairment has been sug- gested to be important in neurodegenerative diseases from many in vitro studies and assays of postmortem brain material, it has not yet been directly demonstrated in vivo. Together, our data support the view that prion protein neurotoxicity may be mediated through toxic oligomers. There is growing evidence in protein misfolding disorders that smaller intermediate oligomeric protein species may be biologically more active than larger amyloid fibrils (Caughey and Lansbury, 2003). In studies of prion infectiv- ity, nonfibrillar prion particles with masses equivalent to 1428 PrP molecules are the most efficient initiators of prion disease (Silveira et al., 2005). Our current data also support a cytosolic localization for a small proportion of PrPSc in prion-infected neuronal cells, in line with our previ- ous data demonstrating toxic cytosolic PrPSc aggresomes (Kristiansen et al., 2005). Granular deposits of disease-re- lated PrP have been reported in the cell body of neurons in CJD brain, suggesting the occurrence of intraneuronal prion aggregates (Kovacs et al., 2005). The very high-affin- ity, stoichiometric inhibition of the proteasome we demon- Molec strate means that only a small amount of PrPSc molecules in the cytosol may be necessary to have a toxic effect. How PrPSc oligomers traffic inside neurons and enter the cytosol and result in UPS inhibition is not known. Possible sites of entry include retrotranslocation from the ER (Ma and Lind- quist, 2001; Yedidia et al., 2001) or via endolysosomal membrane destabilization and leakage into the cytosol, as described for diphtheria toxin and other A-B toxins (Sandvig and van Deurs, 2002) and Ab142 (Ji et al., 2006). It is also possible that PrPSc accumulation in the endolyso- somal system causes dysfunction of this pathway, result- ing indirectly in an increased burden on the UPS. Previous studies have suggested that intracellular neu- ronal propagation of pathogenic PrP appears important for neurotoxicity (Mallucci et al., 2003; Chesebro et al., 2005; Brandner et al., 1996). Here, we have shown results that suggest an intracellular mechanism whereby toxic prion oligomers impair the proteasome in vivo by inhibiting the catalytic b subunits. The pathogenesis of prion dis- ease is likely to be multifactorial, but the potent inhibition of the proteasome by pathogenic PrP is likely to result in neuronal perturbation and contribute to the widespread neuronal loss. Our data also explain how cytosolic PrPC may accumulate in prion disease, with UPS inhibition leading to the cytosolic accumulation of PrPC destined for ER-associated degradation (Ma and Lindquist, 2002). Impairment of the UPS leads to cellular dysfunction and apoptosis through many different mechanisms, as the UPS is also involved in transcriptional regulation, cell- cycle control, and control of apoptosis (Goldberg, 2003). The key feature of prion disease, autocatalytic conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, will form a positive feedback loop by inhibiting the UPS, thereby reducing the rate of clearance of PrPSc and thus stimulating the formation of more PrPSc until the levels of proteasome function are too low for cell survival. A key question that arises is whether our find- ings are relevant to other neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding or a unique property specific to prion diseases. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Prion Infection GT-1 and N2aPK-1 mouse neuronal cells were exposed to homoge- nates from RML prion-infected or uninfected CD-1 mouse brain. Cells were subcultured, tested for the presence of newly generated PrPSc, and cured of prion infection (Kristiansen et al., 2005). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis Cells and brain tissue were homogenized, proteinase K digested, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted (Kristiansen et al., 2005). For assaying proteasome subunits, immunoblotting was performed (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Preparation of Recombinant Protein Species Recombinant murine PrP23231 in either the oxidized a form or the re- duced b form was prepared (Jackson et al., 1999a, 1999b). Proteins were buffer exchanged into PBS. Monomeric a-PrP was aggregated by thermal denaturation (70C for 10 min). Aggregated b-PrP was pro- duced by increasing the salt concentration to 270 mM and was allowed ular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevier Inc. 185 Molecular Cell Oligomeric PrP Species Inhibit Proteasome Function to proceed for 1 hr. Aggregated b-PrP was denatured by ten cycles of freeze/boiling at 100C. a-PrP amyloid fibrils were prepared as de- scribed (Baskakov et al., 2002) and visualized by EM. Lysozyme was aggregated by the addition of 50 mM DTT for 1 hr. Amyloid-b140 (Sigma) was aggregated immediately by the addition of water and as- sayed at a final concentration of 100 mg/ml. SOD1 wild-type and SOD1 mutant (G37R) recombinant proteins were prepared in PBS, and a-lactalbumin (Sigma) was prepared in water. All proteins were assayed at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml unless specified. Enrichment of PrPSc from ScGT-1 Cells After 24 hr of 1 mM lactacystin treatment, ten 10 cm plates of ScGT-1 or ScN2aPK-1 cells were harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS, freeze- thawed three times, and centrifuged at 1000 3 g for 10 min at 4C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was adjusted with an equal volume of 23 lysis buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 7.4[, 300 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% deoxycholate) followed by incubation with benzonase (50 U/ml) for 20 min at 4C. Lysates were incubated with PK at 1 mg/mg protein (37C, 90 min), followed by treat- ment with AEBSF (8 mM) for 10 min at 37C. The whole mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 3 g for 45 min, sonicated in PBS to dissociate the material, and the presence of PrPSc was confirmed by immuno- blotting. The pellet of PrPSc was assayed at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. PrPSc was denatured as described for b-PrP above. For enrich- ment of PrPSc from RML-infected mouse brain, a modification of the above protocol was used (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Probing Proteasome b Subunit Activity Using Activity Probes To prepare lysates for proteasome activity probe assays, N2aPK-1 cells or CGNs were pelleted and lysed in fresh lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 250 mM sucrose, and 1 mM DTT) as described (Berkers et al., 2005). One-hundred micrograms of protein was incubated with 1 mM dansylAhx3L3VS probe for 1 hr at 37C before assaying by immunoblotting. For live-cell experiments, GT-1 cells were incubated with 10 mM probe in culture for 1 hr at 37C before pelleting and lysing as above. For assays with 26S proteasome, either 100, 300, or 900 ng 26S proteasome (BIOMOL) was incubated with 1 mM probe for 1 hr at 37C before assaying by immunoblotting (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All recombinant pro- teins were incubated for 1 hr at 37C in the presence of 2 mM ATP with 100 mg cell lysates, before a further 1 hr incubation at 37C with 1 mM probe. Assaying Proteasome Activity with Fluorogenic Substrates Assays were performed as described (Berkers et al., 2005; Dantuma et al., 2000; Kisselev and Goldberg, 2005). Ten micrograms of pro- tein from cell lysates was added to 100 ml reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, and 100 mM Suc-LLVY-AMC (BIOMOL), Boc-LRR-AMC (BIOMOL), or Ac-nLPnLD-AMC (BACHEM). Fluorescence was measured every min- ute for 30 min at 37C by using a TECAN 96-well plate reader (lex/lem = 360/440nm). Nonspecific hydrolysis was assessed by preincubation of cells for 30 min at 37C with 50 mM epoxomicin and subtracted from each measurement. Lysates of 10% brain homogenate were prepared in homogenisation buffer, freeze-thawed three times, and sonicated before digestion with benzonase (50 U/ml on ice, 15 min) and centrifu- gation at 16,000 3 g for 10 min at 4C. A 10 mg cytosolic brain fraction was assayed as described above. For pure proteasome assays, 10 ng of pure 26S proteasome or 10 ng (0.014 pmol) 20S proteasome (BIOMOL) activated with 32 ng (0.06 pmol) of human PA28a/b activator (BIOMOL) was added to 100 ml reaction buffer and assayed as de- scribed above. All recombinant proteins were incubated for 1 hr at 37C in the presence of 2 mM ATP with 10 mg cell lysates, 10 ng 26S proteasome, or 10 ng of PA28-activated 20S proteasome, before incu- bation with fluorogenic substrates in reaction buffer as described above (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). 186 Molecular Cell 26, 175188, April 27, 2007 2007 Elsevie Live-Cell GFP-Proteasome Reporter Assays Transfection of the UbG76V-GFP construct (Dantuma et al., 2000) into N2aPK-1 cells was performed with Genejammer (Stratagene). Stable cell lines were generated by selection in 600 mg/ml gentamicin (G418). Fluorescence half-life was measured in N2aPK-1-transfected cells by using the FL-1 channel of FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For inhibition of protein synthesis, 20 mg/ml cycloheximide was added for 30 min at 37C prior to fluorescent half-life measurement. For visu- alization of GFP accumulation, UbG76V-GFP-transfected N2aPK-1 cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in 4% PFA, permeabilized in ice-cold methanol, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum before visualization by using the confocal microscope (Zeiss) (see Supple- mental Experimental Procedures). Confocal Microscopy and Immunofluorescence These were performed as described (Kristiansen et al., 2005). Antibody details are in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Incubation of b-PrP and PrPSc with Oligomer-Specific and Anti-PrP Antibodies Either 500 ng/ml aggregated b-PrP or 500 ng/ml PrPSc was incubated (RT, 1 hr) with 5 mg/ml or 150 mg/ml of a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against oligomeric protein species (Kayed et al., 2003) or 150 mg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-PrP antibodies (ICSM 4, 18, or 35). These mixtures were incubated with 100 mg of cytosolic fraction from cell lysates (1 hr, 37C) with 2 mM ATP on a shaker before addi- tion of 1 mM probe (1 hr, 37C), and analysis by immunoblotting was as described above. For controls, aggregated b-PrP or PrPSc was incu- bated (1 hr, 37C) with mouse monoclonal (Sigma; 150 mg/ml) or rabbit polyclonal b-actin antibodies (Abcam; 150 mg/ml) before incubation with 100 mg cell lysates. Native Gel Fluorogenic Activity Stain and Immunoblotting Native gel chymotrypsin activity stain and native gel immunoblotting using anti-19S and 20S antibodies were performed as described (Elsasser et al., 2005) with minor modifications using the Invitrogen NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris 3%12% Gel system (Invitrogen) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Prion Infection of GFP-Proteasome Reporter Mice Two lines of transgenic UPS-reporter mice, UbG76V-GFP/1 and 2 (Lindsten et al., 2003), were studied. Mice heterozygous for the trans- gene were bred to C57BL/6 mice, and the offspring were inoculated intracerebrally with 50 ml 1% w/v brain homogenates from 22L infected or uninoculated mice. The mice were followed by visual observation and sacrificed at the time when clear signs of clinical disease were manifested (i.e., rocking gait, ruffled fur, and immobility). Mice were perfused with PBS through the left ventricle, and the brains removed and processed either for histology or for RNA isolation and real-time rtPCR (Dimcheff et al., 2003). Immunohistochemistry Paraffin sections to be stained for GFP, ubiquitin, and PrP were first subjected to pretreatment at 120C for 20 min in citrate buffer (pH 6). Sections for GFAP staining were not pretreated. Antibody details are in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Staining for all but GFP was performed as described (Dimcheff et al., 2003) by using either biotinylated secondary antisera followed by horserad- ish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and amino-ethyl-carbazol as substrate. GFP was detected by using diaminobenzidine as substrate. A total of 20 UbG76V-GFP+/ and 11 UbG76V-GFP/ scrapie- inoculated mice and ten UbG76V-GFP+/ and two UbG76V-GFP/ mice inoculated with normal brain homogenates were examined microscopically. No differences between line 1 and line 2 mice were detected, and data presented are from line 1 mice. r Inc.
