An Optimal Method for Experimental Provocation of Polymorphic Light Eruption An Optimal Method for Experimental Provocation of Polymorphic Light Eruption Chantalle B. van de Pas, MD; John L. Hawk, MD, FRCP; Antony R. Young, PhD; Susan L. Walker, PhD Background:There is controversy about the best method to induce polymorphic light eruption (PLE) experimen- tally. Objectives: To review articles on PLE induction and design a UV radiation protocol that improves success rates with clinically relevant doses of environmentally rel- evant solar-simulated radiation (SSR). Design and Setting: All articles on the experimental provocation of PLE published since 1980 were re- viewed. Photoprovocation of lesions was studied in 25 PLE patients. The 24-hour minimal erythemal dose (MED) of SSR was determined. Thereafter, six 44-cm adja- cent sites on previously affected and previously unaf- fected skin were exposed to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 MED of SSR for 3 to 4 consecutive days. The study period was autumn to spring in London, England (51 north latitude). Main Outcome Measures: Relationship between PLE induction and biological and physical exposure parameters. Conclusions: The review shows that fractionated ery- themally effective UV-A exposures were more success- ful than single-sunburning UV-B doses. Photoprovoca- tion of PLE was successful in 68% of patients after 2 to 3 SSR exposures that were not necessarily erythemal. There was no difference in success rate between previously af- fected and previously unaffected skin. Our data indicate that PLE is more likely to be induced when the natural causes of the disease are simulated. Arch Dermatol. 2004;140:286-292 P OLYMORPHIC LIGHT ERUP-tion (PLE) is the most com-mon of the so-called idio-pathic photodermatoses. Ina recent population survey1 in the United Kingdom, PLE was found to affect 15% of healthy people, with a female- male ratio of approximately 2:1. Genetic modeling using twin studies and families with PLE provides unequivocal evidence for a genetic basis for PLE and predicts that susceptibility to PLE is a polygenic trait with multiple susceptibility loci.2,3 Poly- morphic light eruption is characterized by a delayed abnormal reaction to the UV ra- diation (UVR) component of sunlight con- sisting of transient, nonscarring, pruritic papules and vesicles, typically develop- ing hours or days after sun exposure and resolving over several days without se- quelae. The pathogenesis of PLE is un- clear, but histologic and immunologic studies suggest that the normal UVR- induced suppression of cell-mediated im- munity is impaired and, as a result, these patients develop a T-cell mediated re- sponse to a UVR-activated antigen (photoantigen).4,5 Investigations into the pathogenesis of PLE have been frustrated by the lack of reliable laboratory methods for the induc- tion of clinical lesions. The results of such studies have varied considerably. The early PLE induction studies reported success rates from as low as 10% to 30%6-8 to as high as 60% to 95%.9-11 These studies were based on one or more exposures of a single test site to between 1 and 10 times the minimal erythemal dose (MED) of nomi- nal UV-B radiation (ie, 290-320 nm), al- though these sources almost certainly con- tained other UVR wavelengths. Initially, induction was achieved with UV-B,6-13 but several authors also succeeded in repro- ducing PLE lesions with UV-A irradia- tion (320-400 nm).12,14-21 See also pages 295 and 351 CME course available at www.archdermatol.com STUDY From the St Johns Institute of Dermatology, Guys, Kings, and St Thomas School of Medicine, Kings College London, England.

Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ by a New York University User on 05/04/2019 There are somewhat contradictory results about the wavelength dependence of PLE. In general, UV-A ap- pears to be more effective than UV-B in eliciting lesions.14 In a comprehensive study of 142 patients in which induc- tion was attempted with increasing exposures of buttock skin to UV-A and/or UV-B daily for 4 to 8 days, the most effective waveband was UV-A (56%), followed by UV-A/ UV-B combination (27%), then UV-B (17%).12 How- ever, Miyamoto13 has confirmed earlier reports22-24 that UV-B can also be successful in a high proportion (57%) of selected patients. In a retrospective study of 30 pa- tients by Mastalier et al,21 the action spectrum fell within the UV-A range in 59% of patients, the UV-B range in 23%, and both ranges in 18%. The diversity in the wavelength- dependence studies remains unexplained. It would be puz- zling if a single chromophore and a uniform mechanism could be activated by different parts of the UVR spectrum and result in such a morphologic diversity of lesions. This would indicate different pathogenic mechanisms or that there is a range of UVR-induced antigens. According to Norris et al,25 studies of laboratory- induced lesions have generally used UVR doses consid- erably in excess of the MED.26-28 This makes histologic interpretation difficult because of coexistent sunburn, which results in mononuclear cell infiltration. Even re- cent studies have used high doses to provoke a PLE re- action (3.3 MED of UV-B19; 6 MED of UV-B20; and 2-4 MED of UV-B or UV-A29). Different locations have been used to provoke PLE with varying degrees of success. Barnadas et al,18 McFadden et al,30 Mastalier et al,21 and Norris et al31 used previously affected skin with success rates of 30%, 100%, 57%, and 100% respectively. Boonstra et al29 pro- voked PLE in previously affected skin to UV-B/UV-A combination exposure in 88% of men and 52% of women. Within this group, PLE was also induced by UV-B alone in 9% of the men and 24% of the women. Reactions to UV-A alone occurred in 3% of men and 24% of women and to visible light in 43% of men and 11% of women. Verheyen et al19 and Lambert et al20 used whole body and upper arm exposure and had UV-A success rates on previously affected sites of 100% and 87%, respectively, and 0% and 6.7% with UV-B. Holzle et al14 tried to provoke PLE on previously exposed and previously unexposed skin. The success rates ranged from 0% to 90% on previously exposed skin, but it was 0% on previously unexposed skin. A synopsis of findings from our literature review is provided in the Table. The aim of our investigation was to evaluate provocation test methods introduced since 1980 and to develop a reliable test using physiologically relevant doses of SSR to study the pathogenesis of PLE. METHODS VOLUNTEERS Twenty-five patients diagnosed with PLE at the Photobiology Clinic of St Johns Institute of Dermatology, London, England, were randomly recruited into the study (21 women, 4 men; age range, 18-55 years; mean age, 38 years; skin types I-V). Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical history and examination. All patients had PLE for at least 6 years, and the condition was defined as a fully resolving macular, papu- lar, or papulovesicular photoeruption occurring 30 minutes to 48 hours after sun exposure and lasting for hours to at least a day. Patients were screened by blood analysis to exclude those with porphyria and by estimation of antinuclear and extract- able nuclear antigen autoantibodies to exclude those with lu- pus. Skin type was assessed by interview. Exclusion criteria for all volunteers included ingestion of any medication during or 2 weeks prior to the study (oral contraceptives excepted), pho- totherapy during or in the 6 months prior to the study, previ- ous exposure of buttock skin to sunlamps or sunlight, and/or a recent sunburn. Pregnant or lactating women were also ex- cluded. The local ethics committee approved the study, and each volunteer was fully informed of the procedures and gave writ- ten informed consent to participate. UVR SOURCE AND DOSIMETRY Solar-simulated radiation (SSR) was generated by a 1-kW xe- non arc solar simulator (Oriel, Stratford, Conn) fitted with a WG320/1-mm-thick glass filter, giving an even field of irradi- ance (approximately 290-400 nm) of about 15 mW/cm2 on the skin surface at 11 cm from the source. Irradiance was rou- tinely determined with a wideband thermopile radiometer (Medi- cal Physics, Dryburn Hospital, Durham, England) calibrated against a DM150 double monochromator Bentham spectrora- diometer (Bentham Instruments, Reading, England). See filter 2 of the first figure in Harrison and Young32 for emission spec- trum details. Eighty-eight percent of the erythemally effective energy of the source was in the UV-B range, and the remaining 12% was UV-A. INDUCTION OF LESIONS In each patient, the just visibly perceptible 24-hour MED was determined on previously unexposed buttock skin using eight 25% dose increments. Photoprovocation was attempted on 2 body sites: (1) previously affected skin (either the arm or upper back) and (2) previously unaffected skin (buttock). Six adjacent sites (44 cm each), were exposed to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 buttock MED in an attempt to induce PLE lesions. The exposures were repeated daily until a positive PLE response was obtained. If no lesions appeared after 3 or 4 days of exposure, the test was considered negative. (Twenty- three of 25 patients had a maximum of 3 exposures; only 2 of 25 patients had a maximum of 4 exposures.) Photoprovoca- tion in 18 patients was performed from October 2001 to May 2002 and in a further 7 patients from November 2002 to March 2003. UVR-INDUCED ERYTHEMA Using a reflectance meter (Diastron, Andover, England), we took 3 quantitative measurements of erythema 24 hours after the sec- ond SSR exposure and calculated the mean per site. For each site, the increase in erythema index was calculated by subtract- ing the mean background reading of adjacent nonirradiated skin. STATISTICAL METHODS Microsoft (Redmond, Wash) Excel 2000 was used for statisti- cal analysis. Linear regression was performed for increase in erythema index vs SSR dose (MED fraction) for each volun- teer on previously exposed and previously unexposed test sites to generate erythema dose-response slopes (83% of the regres- sions had R2 values 0.7), the slope being indicative of the over- all erythema response. The distribution of the slopes was shown (REPRINTED) ARCH DERMATOL / VOL 140, MAR 2004 WWW.ARCHDERMATOL.COM 287 2004 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Significance was assumed at P.05. RESULTS CLINICAL PRESENTATION The morphologic features of PLE lesions induced by pho- toprovocation were consistent with the response re- ported by each patient after previous sun exposure. Thus, with SSR we were able to produce lesions comparable to those seen in the genuine disease. The PLE lesions de- veloped 1 to 24 hours after the last irradiation and con- sisted of macular, small papular (Figure 1A), or papu- lovesicular (Figure 1B) lesions scattered over the irradiated site. The papular or papulovesicular lesions were some- times sparsely scattered over the irradiated area, al- though almost confluent lesions developed as well. In all patients, the recurrence of the rash was asso- ciated with pruritus. Shortly thereafter, patchy or con- fluent erythema developed in which the characteristic skin lesions emerged. Lesions persisted for at least 12 hours and up to 2 weeks after the last exposure. Figure 1A shows a papular reactions of increasing severity after 3 con- secutive exposures to 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 MED. Fig- ure 1B shows a papulovesicular PLE reaction after 3 con- secutive exposures on 1.25 and 1.5 MED sites. Experimentally induced skin lesions usually resolved over the next 1 to 3 days, but it generally took 1 to 3 weeks before they completely disappeared. ERYTHEMA Erythema was shown to be SSR dose dependent, and the slopes were significantly steeper on the buttock site than on the previously exposed site (Figure 2). There was no difference in the erythema response on either test site between patients in whom PLE was successfully in- duced and those in whom it was not (Figure 2). LEVEL OF RESPONSE Seventeen (68%) of 25 patients developed PLE on at least 1 test site. Figure 3 shows the number of sites with a positive response at a given dose level, regardless of the number of exposures. Six patients developed PLE only on previously affected sites (upper back or arm); 4 pa- tients developed PLE only on previously unaffected sites Provocation Tests Since 1980 (cont) Source UV Source Wavelengths Exposures Size Template Location Doses Given Success Rate, % Profile, No. of Patients Skin Type Lambert et al20 PUVA cabin with Philips TL09 UV-A Single/ multiple UV-A whole body Whole body 15, 20, or 25 J/cm2 UV-A for max 5 consecutive days UV-A 87 45: 40 F, 5 M; mean age, 35 y I, II, III UV-B Philips TL12 UV-B Single/ multiple UV-B 4  4 cm Upper arm UV-B 3  3.3 MED UV-B 6.7 Mastalier et al21 1.

Polymorphic light eruption was readily provoked on both previously exposed and previously unexposed skin. Eleven (65%) of 17 patients responded on buttock skin and 13 (77%) of 17 responded on arm and/or back. NUMBER OF EXPOSURES Successful provocation of PLE was dependent on the num- ber of exposures. In both skin sites, success increased with increasing number of daily exposures. Figure 4 shows the cumulative success rate for both sites, regardless of the dose used. The data show that 3 exposures are nec- essary to obtain a success rate of more than 50%. How- ever, Figure 3 also shows that it is possible to provoke PLE with a single SSR exposure on buttock skin (1 pa- tient with macular lesions) and on arm and/or back skin (2 patients with papular lesions). COMMENT A summary of articles published since 1980 on the ex- perimental provocation of PLE is provided in Table 1. This shows a very diverse range of UVR spectra, doses, and induction protocols, and sometimes it is difficult to determine the exact radiation protocol. In general, the doses given, whether single or repeated, have been greater than 1 MED. Only our group25 has previously used SSR A B 0.25 MED 0.75 MED 1.25 MED 0.5 MED 1.0 MED 1.5 MED 0.25 MED 0.75 MED 1.25 MED 0.5 MED 1.0 MED 1.5 MED Figure 1. Polymorphic light eruption (PLE) is provoked with solar-simulated radiation. A, Typical papular PLE lesions are seen on buttock skin after 3 exposures of 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 minimal erythemal doses (MEDs). As shown here, reactions were generally stronger with higher doses.

The data show the number of sites with a PLE response at a given SSR dose, regardless of the number of exposures. The theoretical maximum for each site is the number of patients (N=25). This means that 1 (4%) of 25 buttock sites responded with 0.25minimal erythemal dose (MED) exposures and that 12 (48%) of 25 arm and/or back sites responded with 1.5-MED exposures.

The results show the cumulative percentage of patients with positive reactions on buttock and arm and/or back skin with the minimum solar-simulated radiation (SSR) dose used. At least 3 exposures were necessary to provoke PLE in at least 50% of patients. There is no difference between previously exposed and previously unexposed skin. Not all patients reacted on both sites. Two important caveats: (1) 1 patient was included who showed PLE on the buttock minimal erythemal dose test site after a single exposure; (2) the cumulative value does not reach 68% because patients required different numbers of exposures on different sites and some patients reacted on one site but not on the other.

Furthermore, in some cases the doses would have been phototoxic, causing a severe erythemal reaction. In general, studies with UV-A have been more suc- cessful than those with UV-B. Solar UVR is mostly UV-A (approximately 95%), yet the approximate 5% UV-B causes more than 80% of the sunburn. Patients often report PLE without sunburn, which has led clinicians to believe that the disease may be triggered with suberythemal UV-A ex- posure. Yet, success with UV-A dose-response studies has been with doses that were certainly erythemal (eg, 60- 100 J/cm2 in Holzle et al14 and 50 J/cm2 in 20 of 22 pa- tients in McFadden and Larsen15). In this context, such studies do not reproduce the natural situation. We have successfully reproduced PLE in a small group of PLE patients using environmentally and physi- ologically relevant UVR exposures. This was done with comparable rates of success on previously exposed and unexposed skin. The erythemal response after 2 expo- sures on the buttock was much greater than that on the arm and/or back, as shown in Figure 2, almost certainly because buttock MED was lower than the MED of sites that had a history of exposure. In other words, our pro- tocol was less inflammatory on the arm and back than on the buttock. Polymorphic light eruption can be induced by sub- erythemal exposures, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 2 shows PLE in association with very shallow erythema dose- response curves, especially on the arm and back. These observations are consistent with patient reports that PLE may evolve without concomitant sunburn. Overall, our data show that erythema and PLE are independent clini- cal outcomes, suggesting that they have different chro- mophores. DNA is thought to be the major chromo- phore for erythema,33 but as yet we have no candidate chromophores for PLE. The most frequent outcome was pruritus and ery- thema in combination with papular or papulovesicular lesions, which accounted for 88% of the positive reac- tions. The remaining 12% involved pruritis, erythema, and macules that persisted for at least 12 hours after the last exposure. The lesions were sometimes sparsely scat- tered over the irradiated area, which means that test areas should not be too small. Thus, we believe that our 44-cm test area for each dose is appropriate. Larger areas are not necessary: Neumann et al16 have shown that whole body UV-A exposure was no more effective than the ex- posure of smaller previously involved skin sites. Our success rate was 68% (17/25), which is good compared with most of the reports in Table 1. There was little difference between the success rates on previously affected sites (13/17; 76%) and previously unaffected sites (12/17; 71%). Most studies have attempted to induce PLE on previously sun-exposed sites.12,14,15,18,31 Only 2 other studies14,18 attempted, without clear success, to induce PLE on previously unaffected (ie, nonsun-exposed) sites. Our results clearly show that successful provocation of PLE is not dependent on skin site. Polymorphic light eruption usually requires sev- eral consecutive exposures to sunlight. We thus tried to simulate the natural conditions with repeated daily ex- posures of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 just percep- tible MEDs. Unfortunately, the total number of expo- sures was limited because most patients were not willing to cooperate for more than 4 consecutive exposures. The influence of number of exposures is shown in Figure 4. This shows that at least 3 exposures are necessary to ob- tain a success rate of at least 50% on previously exposed and previously unexposed skin. The SSR dose (cumulative physical dose) required to induce PLE ranged from 1.7 to 25 J/cm2 (mean MED, 4.9 J/cm2 ; range, 2.6-10.1 J/cm2), and there was no evi- dent correlation between outcome and cumulative physi- cal dose. In a recent study,5 members of our group used single exposure doses of 0.6, 1, or 2 MED to induce im- munosuppression in PLE patients and in age- and skin typematched controls. Exposure to 1 MED suppressed contact hypersensitivity response by 78% in controls but induced significantly less suppression (44%) in PLE pa- tients (P.01). Suppression was also less in PLE pa- tients than in controls after 0.6 MED (31% vs 43%), but this did not reach significance (P=.50). In contrast, sup- pression was almost complete (93%) in both PLE pa- tients and controls after exposure to 2 MED, suggesting that PLE patients have a resistance to immunosuppres- sion after low to moderate doses of UVR, but resistance to immunosuppression can be overcome if higher UVR doses are given. It is possible that more exposures would have in- creased our success rate. On the other hand, the clinical symptoms of PLE are likely to represent a balance be- tween the induction of the putative photoantigen and the UVR-induced suppression of the immunologic re- sponse to the antigen. Such a balance is likely to be highly dependent on individual immunologic and UVR expo- sure parameters. Polymorphic light eruption was pro- voked after a single exposure in 3 (18%) of 17 patients, and in 1 of these cases the PLE was evident after the MED series. This contrasts with the findings of other au- thors,15,25,27,28,30,31 who reported good results from a single exposure with a wide range of sources and doses. In conclusion, we have shown that PLE can be readily induced when the natural causes of the disease are simu- lated. The lack of consistent results from studies of the PLE action spectrum further supports the use of SSR. We have also shown, for the first time, that the condition can be just as readily provoked on previously unexposed sites. This indicates that the putative photoantigen can be in- duced de novo. Finally, we believe that a standard pro- tocol for the induction and assessment of PLE would ben- efit research and clinical practice, and we advocate that researchers in this field work toward this end.
