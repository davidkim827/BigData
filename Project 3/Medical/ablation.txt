Prusiner, August 24, 1993 ABSTRACT Mice, homozygous for prion protein (PrP) gene ablation (Prn-p/), develop normally and remain well >500 days after inoculation with murine scrapie prions. In contrast, wild-type mice developed scrapie <165 days after inoculation and most Prn-p/+ mice, heterozygous for disrup- tion of the PrP gene, exhibited signs of central nervous system dysfunction between 400 and 465 days after inoculation. In situ immunoblots showed widespread deposition of scrapie PrP (PrPsc) in the brains of both wild-type Prn-p+/+ and Prn-pO/+ mice, while neither cellular PrP (PrPc) nor PrPsc was detected in the brains of Prn-p/ mice. In contrast to Prn-p+/+ and Prn-p/+ mice, Prn-p/ mice failed to propagate prion infec- tivity as measured by bioassays. Syrian hamster (SHa) PrP transgenes rendered Prn-p/ mice susceptible to prions con- taining SHaPrPsc. Immunization of Prn-p0/ mice with puri- fied, infectious mouse or SHa prions dispersed in Freund's adjuvant produced antisera that bound mouse, SHa, and human PrP on Western blots. Presumably, the lack of prPC expression in Prn-p0/ mice prevents them from becoming tolerant to the immunogen. The resistance of Prn-p/O mice to developing scrapie after inoculation with murine prions sup- ports the hypothesis that PrPsc is essential for both transmis- sion and pathogenesis of the prion diseases. Scrapie was the first prion disease to be transmitted to laboratory rodents (1) and hence is the most widely studied of these transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. Scrapie is a naturally occurring disease of sheep and goats (2). Some investigators have contended that scrapie is an infectious disorder (3), while others have argued that it is a genetic disease (4). Studies of the human prion diseases, which are manifest as infectious, genetic, or sporadic disorders, argue that both views of natural scrapie are likely to have merit (5, 6). The prion protein (PrP) was discovered by progressively enriching fractions for scrapie infectivity first from mouse (Mo) brain and later from Syrian hamster (SHa) (7-9). N-terminal sequencing ofthe protease-resistant protein, later designated PrP 27-30, allowed synthesis of an isocoding mixture of oligonucleotides (10) that were used to screen cDNA libraries prepared from hamster and mouse brains (11, 12). The PrP gene was found to be a chromosomal gene and the levels of PrP mRNA were unchanged throughout the course of scrapie infection (11). This finding led to the identification of cellular PrP (PrPC) from which scrapie PrP (PrPSc) (and PrP 27-30) are produced during scrapie. The central role of PrPSc in the transmission and patho- genesis of prion diseases was established over the past decade by a wide variety of experimental approaches (6, 13). The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment. This article must therefore be hereby marked "advertisement" in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1734 solely to indicate this fact. These studies have also demonstrated that PrPSc is an es- sential, and possibly the only, component of the infectious prion particle (14). With the development of gene targeting technology, it became feasible to disrupt the MoPrP gene (Prn-p) by cre- ating a construct in which "=75% of the open reading frame was replaced by an aminoglucoside phosphotransferase gene (15). Unexpectedly, ablation ofboth alleles ofthe single copy PrP gene (Prn-p/) has had no deleterious effects on the development, behavior, or life-span of the mice. Since earlier studies with transgenic (Tg) mice had shown that the incubation time is inversely related to the level of PrP transgene expression (16-19), the availability of Prn-pO/+ and Prn-p0/0 mice created opportunities to extend those findings and to test again the hypothesis that PrPSc is an essential component of the infectious prion. Those earlier investiga- tions also indicated that the relative levels of SHaPrPC and MoPrPC influenced incubation times. Thus, we inoculated Prn-pO/+ and Prn-p/ mice with Mo and SHa prions and compared the incubation times to those in wild-type Prn-p+/+ and Tg(SHaPrP) mice. We also examined the patterns of PrPSc accumulation in the mice and measured the titers of infectious prions produced. Our results are similar to those reported by others using the same line of Prn-p/ mice (20). The production of anti-PrP antibodies (Abs) in rabbits required large amounts of purified SHaPrP 27-30 (21, 22) as did the subsequent production of anti-PrP monoclonal anti- bodies (mAbs) in mice (23, 24) but these mAbs recognize only a few epitopes on SHaPrP and human PrP and none on MoPrP (25, 26). These anti-PrP mAbs react equally well with denatured PrPSc and nondenatured PrPC (27). Since Prn-p0/ mice should not be tolerant to MoPrPC, we immunized these animals to produce anti-PrP Abs. MATERIALS AND METHODS All chemicals were of the highest grades commercially avail- able. SDS, acrylamide, and protein standards were obtained from Bio-Rad, guanidinium salts and Sarkosyl were from Fluka, and urea was from Schwarz/Mann. Mice were inoculated with prions derived from the Chan- dler scrapie isolate (1), which was designated RML, after repeated passage in Swiss CD-1 mice obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Homogenates were prepared from the brains of clinically ill CD-1 mice by dispersion in 0.32 M sucrose (10%, wt/vol).

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 (1993) 10609 Scrapie prion isolates designated Sc237 and 139H were passaged in random-bred Syrian hamsters (Lak:LVG) ob- tained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Sc237 prions were derived from an inoculum provided by Richard Marsh (University of Wisconsin, Madison) (28) and are similar to 263K prions (29). 139H prions were obtained from Richard Kimberlin and Richard Carp (Institute for Basic Research, Staten Island, NY) (30). Mice were anesthetized with ether and inoculated intra- cerebrally with 30 ,ul of 10%o (wt/vol) brain homogenates using a 27-gauge disposable hypodermic needle inserted into the right parietal lobe. Criteria for diagnosis of scrapie in mice have been described (31). After inoculation, the mice were examined for neurologic dysfunction three times per week. Prion titers in brain homogenates were calculated from curves relating titers to incubation times (32). A molecular clone containing the third exon of the Prn-p gene was modified by removing 183 codons of PrP and substituting the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. This modified PrP gene was introduced into ES cells derived from agouti 129 mice (33) and recombinants were selected (15). Chimeric offspring were mated to C57BL6 mice; those het- erozygous (Prn-pO/+) for the PrP gene ablation were mated to each other. Homozygous (Prn-p0/0) offspring were found to develop normally (15) and remain healthy for >600 days. Screening for Prn-p/0 and Pmn-pO/+ mice was accom- plished by PCR using three primers: RK1 (TCAGCCTA- AATACTGGGCAC), RK2 (GCCTAGACCACGAGA- AATGC), and RK3 (GCATCAGCCATGATGGATAC). The 5' primer RK1 and the 3' primer RK2 are located outside the MoPrP open reading frame; they create an 880-bp fragment. Amplification of the Neo gene was achieved with RK1 and the 3' pnmer RK3 producing a 730-bp fragment. DNA was extracted from an amputated piece of tail and amplified by PCR. The PCR mixture contained 200 ,uM each dNTP, 0.2 ,uM RK1, 0.2 ,uM RK2, 0.2 ,uM RK3, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 50 mM KCI, 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.4), and 2.5 mM MgCl2 in 25 ,ul. A Geneamp 9600 (Applied Biosystems) was programmed for one cycle at 94C, 30 s followed by 42 cycles: 94C, 15 s for denaturation; 62C, 15 s for annealing; and 72C, 45 s for polynucleotide exten- sion. Since RK1 and RK2 are specific for MoPrP, foreign transgenes such as SHaPrP were not amplified by PCR with these primers. SHaPrP transgenes were detected as de- scribed (16). Cryostat sections of brain were digested with proteinase K to eliminate PrPC prior to denaturation of PrPSc with guani- dinium thiocyanate to enhance its antigenicity (34). These in situ immunoblots were stained with anti-PrP polyclonal rab- bit antiserum (R073) (27). Purified prion rods were prepared from the brains ofclinically ill CD-1 mice inoculated with RML prions or Syrian hamsters with Sc237 prions (35). Prion rods were recovered from sucrose gradient fractions by diluting the 50% sucrose 2:1 with distilled H20 followed by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 6 h at 40C. The pellet was washed in an equal volume of distilled H20 and after centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 6 h at 40C the rods were resuspended at 1 mg/ml in Ca/Mg-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% Sarkosyl. The major protein in both preparations was PrP 27-30 as judged by silver staining after SDS/PAGE. Protein was determined by a bicinchoninic acid dye binding with bovine serum albumin used as the standard (Pierce). Prn-p/O mice were injected intraperitoneally with 30 pg of prion rods emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Mice were given booster injections at 2-week inter- vals with incomplete Freund's adjuvant containing first 30 pg and then 15 ug of rods. After the second injection, mice were bled from the tail; antisera were stored at -200C. Rodent and human brain tissues were disrupted in Mg/ Ca-free PBS by passage through a 20-gauge needle 5 times and followed by passage through a 22-gauge needle 10 times. The 10o (wt/vol) homogenate was centrifuged at 1600 x g for 5 min at 4C. Typically, 500 ,ug of supernatant protein as measured by dye binding was present in 30-50 ,ul. The protein was diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in Mg/Ca-free PBS containing 0.2% Sarkosyl. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2 x SDS/PAGE buffer without 2-mercapto- ethanol and boiled for 5 min before SDS/PAGE (36). Immu- noblotting was performed as described (37) except for the use of primary mouse antiserum diluted 1:1000. RESULTS Scrapie Incubation Times. Homogenates of Mo(RML) pri- ons containing 0.2% Sarkosyl were heated at 80C for 20 min and irradiated with 230 kJ of irradiation per m2 at 254 nm (38) to eliminate any spurious pathogens such as the Casitas murine retrovirus that produces spongiform degeneration (39, 40) but no PrPSc (D.G., R. Jaenisch, and S.B.P., unpub- lished data). Bioassay of this inoculum in CD-1 mice gave an incubation time for onset of illness of 151  2.0 days (mean + SEM; n = 18) compared to mice with an untreated inoculum of 146  1.3 (mean  SEM; n = 18), indicating similar titers of z106 ID50 units/ml (32). Pmn-p+/+ mice as well as PrP gene ablated Pmn-pO/+ and PNn-pO/ mice were inoculated with Mo(RML) prions that had been both heated and irradiated. Both non-Tg littermates and CD-1 Swiss mice expressing wild-type MoPrP-A had incu- bation times of <165 days (Fig. 1). Prn-pO/+ mice, heterozy- gous for ablation of the PrP gene, had prolonged incubation times ranging between 400 and 465 days. In contrast, Prn-p/ mice have remained resistant to scrapie prions for >500 days. Patterns of PrPsc Accumulation in Brain. Prn-p+/+ mice were inoculated with Mo(RML) prions and sacrificed after developing signs of neurologic dysfunction; PrPSc was found by in situ immunoblotting in most brain regions except the neocortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus (Fig. 2A). The histopathology, including spongiform degeneration and re- active astrocytic gliosis, was most intense in the brainstem and thalamus where PrPSc accumulated; little or no pathology was found in the hippocampus or neocortex. Asymptomatic PM-p/ mice were sacrificed 500 days after inoculation but, as expected, neither PrPSc nor histopathology was found (Fig. 2B).

At this time, PrPSC deposits as well as spongiform degeneration and reactive astrocytic gliosis appeared widely distributed throughout the brain. Additional studies are needed to de- termine the mechanism responsible for the differences in PrPSc accumulation between Prn-p+/+ and Pmn-p/+ mice. Prion Titers in Brain. Bioassays in CD-1 mice were per- formed on brain extracts collected from Prn-p+/+, Pn-pO/+, Pm-pO/1 mice sacrificed 5, 60, and 120 days after inoculation. No prions were detected in brain extracts from Prn-p/ mice at 60 and 120 days after inoculation (Table 1). In contrast, Pm-p+/+ mice propagated prions to high titers as reported (20, 41, 42). Pmn-p0/+ mice had intermediate titers of prions at these times. Incubation Times with Hamster Prions. PrP gene ablated mice, Tg(SHaPrP) mice, and crosses between them were inoculated with Mo(RML), SHa(Sc237), and SHa(139H) pri- ons (Table 2). Prn-p+/+, Pm-pO/+, and Prn-p/0 mice were resistant to both the Sc237 and 139H isolates from Syrian hamsters although more prolonged observation is required for the Prn-p+/+ mice inoculated with 139H. The CD-1 mice were more susceptible to 139H than Sc237 prions as reported (43). Incubation times of -50 days were found with the Tg(SHaPrP+/+)7 and Tg(SHaPrP+/0)7 mice inoculated with either isolate of SHa prions. Interestingly, incubation times of =50 days were also recorded in Tg(SHaPrP+/+)81 and Table 2.

Production of Anti-NrP Abs. We immunized Prn-p0/0 mice with Mo and SHa prions dispersed in Freund's adjuvant. In our initial study, 1 of 2 Nrn-p0/0 mice immunized with Mo prions and 0 of 2 mice immunized with SHa prions produced anti-NrP Abs. In a second study, 10 of 10 mice immunized with Mo prions and 10 of 10 mice immunized with SHa prions produced anti-NrP Abs. Anti-NrP Abs in sera were detected by Western blotting. The anti-NrP Abs reacted with Mo, SHa, and human NP (Fig. 3). The anti-NP antisera had titers exceeding 1:5000. DISCUSSION Although there has been a remarkable convergence of ex- perimental results contending that rnPsc is essential for transmission and pathogenesis of prion diseases (6), this conclusion continues to be challenged by some investigators (44-48). The inoculation of Pmn-p00 mice with scrapie prions provided yet another opportunity to test the hypothesis that NPpsc is neither required for development of disease nor necessary for multiplication of scrapie infectivity. If Pm-p0i 0 mice inoculated with Mo prions had developed disease or propagated infectivity, then it could be argued that Psc is unrelated to the transmis'sion as well as the patho- genesis of disease or that Mo prions stimulate the conversion ofanother cellular protein into a pathological isoform through an autocatalytic process. Since Pm-p0S0mice are resistant to scrapie and fail to propagate scrapie infectivity as presented here and elsewhere (20), we conclude that the PrP is neces- sary for both disease pathogenesis and prion propagation. Increased SHaPrP transgene expression shortened incu- bation times for homologous SHa prions and extended them for heterologous Mo prions (16, 17, 19). Crosses between Tg(SHaPrP/)81 and Pmn-p00 mice inoculated with SHa prions (Table 2) lend further support to the hypothesis that competition between endogenous MoPrPC and transgene PrPc for inoculated PrPsc modulate incubation times. The Tg(SHaPrP+/0)81/Prn-p0/0 mice heterozygous for the SHaPrP transgene array had incubation times of -50 days compared to Tg(SHaPrP+/0)81/Prn-p+/+ mice with times of -75 days. Interestingly, Tg(SHaPrP+/+)81/Prn-p+/+ mice also had -50-day incubation times. To date, we have en- countered difficulty in producing Tg(SHaPrP+/+)81/Pm- polo Whether conformation-dependent mAbs that discriminate between PrPSc and PrPC can be produced from Prn-p/0 mice producing anti-MoPrP Abs (Fig. 3) remains to be determined but such mAbs would be invaluable. Spectroscopic data show that prPC has a high a-helical content and virtually no ,&-sheet (37), supporting a four-helix bundle model for PrPC (49). Since PrPSc has a high /-sheet content, it is likely that conversion of prPC into PrPsc involves the unfolding of a-helical domains and their refolding into /-sheets (37). Since ablation of both alleles of the PrP gene does not seem to be deleterious to mice, scrapie cannot be considered a disease ofPrPC inhibition (15). Rather, considerable evidence argues that the accumulation of PrPsc is responsible for the central nervous system dysfunction that attends scrapie (43, 50-52). In accord with these findings is the slow deposition of PrPSc in Prn-pO/+ mouse brains, which is accompanied by a prolongation of the incubation time (Figs. 1 and 2). The results presented here and by others (20) with Prn-p0/0 mice suggest therapeutics for prion diseases. Gene-targeted do- mestic animals such as sheep and cattle could be produced with ablated PrP genes if this does not prove deleterious to the health of the animals. Such sheep would be protected from scrapie and the cattle would be protected from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (53). Alternatively, antisense PrP genes or oligonucleotides should reduce PrP mRNA levels and thus diminish the production of PrPsc. Whether such therapy might be effective in humans who present early in the clinical course of a prion disease is unknown, but it could be administered to patients without symptoms who are at risk for inherited prion diseases.
