ORIGINAL RESEARCH Role of the Cellular Prion Protein in the Neuron Adaptation Strategy to Copper Deficiency Emanuela Urso  Daniela Manno  Antonio Serra  Alessandro Buccolieri  Antonia Rizzello  Antonio Danieli  Raffaele Acierno  Benedetto Salvato  Michele Maffia Received: 22 December 2011 / Accepted: 7 February 2012 / Published online: 24 February 2012  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 Abstract Copper transporter 1 (CTR1), cellular prion protein (PrPC), natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2 (NRAMP2) and ATP7A proteins control the cell absorption and efflux of copper (Cu) ions in nervous tissues upon physiological conditions. Little is known about their regulation under reduced Cu availability, a condition underlying the onset of diffused neurodegenerative disor- ders. In this study, rat neuron-like cells were exposed to Cu starvation for 48 h. The activation of Caspase-3 enzymes and the impairment of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD) activity depicted the initiation of a pro-apoptotic program, preliminary to the appearance of the morpho- logical signs of apoptosis. The transcriptional response related to Cu transport proteins has been investigated. Notably, PrPC transcript and protein levels were consis- tently elevated upon Cu deficiency. The CTR1 protein amount was stable, despite a two-fold increase in the transcript amount, meaning the activation of post-transla- tional regulatory mechanisms. NRAMP2 and ATP7A expressions were unvaried. The up-regulated PrPC has been demonstrated to enhance the cell Cu uptake ability by about 50% with respect to the basal transport, and so sus- tain the Cu delivery to the Cu,Zn SOD cuproenzymes. Conclusively, the study suggests a pivotal role for PrPC in the cell adaptation to Cu limitation through a direct activity of ion uptake. In this view, the PrPC accumulation observed in several cancer cell lines could be interpreted as a molecular marker of cell Cu deficiency and a potential target of therapeutic interventions against disorders caused by metal imbalances. Keywords Copper deficiency  Adaptation  Neuroblastoma  Cellular prion protein  Copper transporters Background Copper (Cu) has been established as an essential cofactor required by fundamental enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways, including those involved in the defence of cells from oxidative damage (Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, SOD), synthesis of ATP (cytochrome c oxidase), cate- cholamine (dopamine b-monooxygenase) and melanin production (tyrosinase), blood clotting processes (Factors V and VIII) and iron metabolism (ceruloplasmin and hephaestin) (Tapiero et al. 2003). The catalytic properties of Cu depend on its ability to easily assume the oxidized (Cu2?) and the reduced (Cu?) states, but just its redox chemistry can give rise to severe cellular alterations due to the production of highly reactive oxygen species (Halliwell and Gutteridge 1984, 1990). To limit the reactivity of this metal, living organisms developed a precise network of transporters and chaperons to properly address Cu ions toward specific compartments and molecules (Valentine and Gralla 1997; Pena et al. 1999; Bertinato and LAbbe 2004; Kim et al. 2008). Cu-transporter 1 (CTR1) is a high affinity Cu? importer spanning three trans-membrane E. Urso  A. Rizzello  A. Danieli  R. Acierno  M.

It exists as a homotrimer embedded in the lipid bilayer and a pore allows the ion translocation across the cell membrane (Nose et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2000; Zhou and Gitschier 1997; Aller and Unger 2006). Another candidate to drive Cu intake is the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1/NRAMP2) (Gunshin et al. 1997), demonstrated to sustain at least the 50% of Cu transport in Caco-2 cells, transporting both the Cu? and the Cu2? species (Arredondo et al. 2003). The cell surface protein cellular prion protein (PrPC), mostly expressed by neurons at synapses and gliocytes (Sales et al. 1998; Brown et al. 1998), is also believed to influence Cu uptake, since the binding of Cu2? ions to its extracellular N-terminal domain stimulates the protein endocytosis, possibly pro- viding a way for cell Cu entry (Pauly and Harris 1998; Perera and Hooper 2001; Harris 1999; Brown 2001). Inside the cell, Cu is delivered to proteins and organelles by specific Cu chaperons targeting it to Cu,Zn SODs (CCS), cytochrome c oxidase (COX17) and the cytosolic domain of Cu-ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B, responsible for Cu- loading onto cuproproteins in the Golgi apparatus and export of ion excess (Markossian and Kurganov 2003; Lutsenko and Petris 2002; Linz and Lutsenko 2007). Imbalances in ion homeostasis at both cellular and systemic levels are linked to symptoms associated to sev- eral neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and prion dis- eases (Donnelly et al. 2007; Gaggelli et al. 2006; Gaeta and Hider 2005; Strausak et al. 2001). Some investigations revealed a role of plasma Cu deficiency in promoting the cognitive decline in Alzheimic subjects (Kessler et al. 2006; Pajonk et al. 2005). In addition, the oral adminis- tration of Cuprizone (Cu chelating agent) to mice has been shown to induce some histopathological features associated to prion infection (Kimberlin 1974; Pattison and Jebbett 1971a, b). To examine in detail the molecular events occurring under Cu depletion independently on causal events, experimental models were set up, in the attempt to resemble a condition shared by several neurodegenerative disorders. In previous studies, Cu-related pathways were stressed in cultured neuroblastoma cells exposed to Cu chelating agents (Bathocuproine sulphonate, trientine) and research focused on the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of the apoptosis program (Lombardo et al. 2003; Rossi et al. 2001). No attention was devoted to the effects evoked on Cu transport systems. In the attempt to go deep in this basic aspect, the main objective of this study was defining in a Cu-depleted neuronal-like cell line (B104) the relative contributions of well-known (CTR1, NRAMP2, ATP7A) and presumed (PrPC) Cu-transporters to the cell adaptive response, in terms of transcriptional and post-translational regulation. The kinetics of Cu uptake during adaptation have been analysed by a fluorimetric method, in order to establish, if possible, a hierarchy in the intervention of the cited Cu- related proteins. In addition, the cell antioxidant status has been studied, with particular reference to the Cu,Zn SOD cuproenzyme activity. Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Treatments B104 neuroblastoma cells, derived from rat central nervous system (Schubert et al. 1974), were grown at 37C, 5% CO2, in Dulbeccos-modified Eagles medium (Euroclone Life Science, Milan, Italy), 1 g/l glucose, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 1 mM Na-pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin 5,000 U/ ml/5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). To deprive cells of Cu, cultures were exposed to 15 lM triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride chelating agent (Tri- entine, Trien; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) for 48 h. They were then processed for subsequent analysis. To prevent clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cells were pre-incubated with 50 lM chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min or with hypertonic sucrose (0.5 M) for 20 min. MTT Assays A preliminary set of cell viability tests was performed, to define the more suitable conditions to study the events triggered by ion deficiency in the absence of covering effects due to Trien self-toxicity and a massive cell loss. To this aim, cells were plated into 96-well trays and exposed to growing concentrations (0100 lM) of Trien for 48 and 96 h. As a control, cultures were simultaneously exposed to CuTrien complex (1:1 molar ratio). 0.5 mg/ml MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphe- nyl-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma-Aldrich] was added to cell cultures for 3 h at 37C. The MTT formazan product was released from cells by adding dimethylsulfoxide and measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm (Mosmann 1983). The percent of survival was assessed by comparison with untreated cultures. Determination of Total Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn) and Iron (Fe) Cell Contents by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were repeatedly washed, lysed and digested in suprapur HNO3 (0.2% v/v). Metal contents of solutions were measured by a Varian AA-600Z 990 Cell Mol Neurobiol (2012) 32:9891001 123 atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Aus- tralia), equipped with a GTA-100 graphite tube atomizer with Zeeman background correction and a PSD-120 auto- sampler. The detection wavelengths were set at 327.4 nm for Cu, 213.9 nm for Zn and 248.3 nm for Fe. Data were analysed by the Varian SpectrAA 3.10 FS software and metal concentrations were expressed as the weight of metal per milligram of proteins (nmol/mg protein). Three sam- ples have been assayed for each quantification. Caspase Activity Assay Caspase-3 activity was measured using the ApoTarget TM Caspase-3 Protease Assay (BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Briefly, cells were treated with 15 lM Trien for 48 h. Aliquots of cell lysates (150 lg protein per sample) were mixed with a reaction buffer containing 200 lM DEVD-pNA, a chromogen substrate and incubated for 2 h at 37C in the dark. Absorbance values were measured at 405 nm and reported as a percentage of readings from the uninduced samples. SOD Activity B104 cells were treated as indicated in Results section. SOD activity was measured by the SOD Assay Kit-WST (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich). This colorimetric assay relies on two concatenated reactions: the generation of superoxide anions (O2 -) through the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and the conversion of WST-1 [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4- nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, mono- sodium salt] tetrazolium salt to a yellow water-soluble formazan dye following reduction by O2 -. SOD activity inhibits the generation of the coloured salt by subtracting superoxide anions to reduction. Briefly, 20 ll lysates (sample wells) were dispensed in triplets into 96-well microplates. Then, 200 ll WST working solution and 20 ll enzyme working solution (xanthine/xanthine oxidase sys- tem) were added to wells. Six blank wells (three for blank 1 and three for blank 2) per microplate were reserved. For blank 1, 20 ll water were added in place of samples. For blank 2, the enzyme working solution was substituted by 20 ll dilution buffer. After 20 min incubation at 37C, the absorbances at 450 nm were registered. SOD activity was calculated as the percent inhibition of WST-1 reduction with O2 -, using the formula: SOD activity  Ablank1  Ablank2   Asample   Ablank1  Ablank2 g  100 Results were normalized against cell number. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Images were acquired from 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed control and Cu-depleted cultures by an A Jeol 4210 STM- AFM microscope. Contact-mode cell images were taken in air at room temperature. Silicon cantilevers with 100-lm length, curvature radius \25 nm and spring constant of 0.05 N/m were used. Real-Time PCR RNA extraction from cells grown at 7080% confluence was performed by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), accordingly to the manufacturers instruc- tions. Total RNA (0.5 lg) was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers in a 20 ll reaction volume by the GeneAmp Gold RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer, Monza, Italy). Amounts of cDNA template from 0.2 to 0.5 lg were needed for real-time PCR analysis.

Reactions were carried out into a 25-ll mixture volume using the SmartCycler System (Cepheid, Euroclone, Milan, Italy) and the threshold cycles (Ct) were averaged from three samples, each analysed in duplicate. The aver- age expression ratio of genes with respect to the control condition was computed by Pfaffls formula (2001). Western Blotting Total proteins were isolated from cell cultures by the TRIzol protocol (Invitrogen). Aliquots to be analysed for prion protein expression were deglycosylated by PNGase F treatment for 3 h at 37C (Enzymatic Protein Deglycosy- lation kit, Sigma-Aldrich). 30100 lg proteins were loaded and run onto 712% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Separated protein bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose mem- branes at 190 mA for 1.5 h. After blocking with PBS-0.1% Tween containing 5% nonfat milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies raised against CTR1 (1:2000, Novus Biologicals), NRAMP2 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), PrPC (1:8000; Sigma-Aldrich), ATP7A (1:1000; Orbigen) overnight at 4C and then with antirabbit (CTR1, NRAMP2, ATP7A) and antimouse (PrPC) peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at room temperature for 1 h. After washes in PBS-0.1% Tween, band detection was performed by a horseradish peroxidase-based chemilumi- nescent detection system (ECL, Amersham). Results were normalized against b-actin. Transport Measurements The kinetics of Cu intake were studied in B104 cells after 48 h Trien treatment by a fluorimetric method, using the green-fluorescent heavy metal indicator Phen Green SK diacetate (PG SK, kexc = 506 nm, kem = 530 nm; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Cells were har- vested and then dye-loaded by incubation for 10 min at 37C in HBSS (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 D-glucose, 10 Hepes; pH 7.4) con- taining 1 lM PG SK. After loading, cells were washed twice by centrifugation and then resuspended in the phys- iological buffer cited above. For each evaluation, an aliquot of cells (3 9 104) was introduced in a cuvette housed in a LS-50B Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer, after the pre- heating of the sample compartment at 37C. Once the emission signal of the probe entrapped within the cells was stable, Cu chloride was added at different concentra- tions (05 lM) and the rate of fluorescence quenching (DF a.u. s-1 nr cells-1 10-5) was monitored as an indi- cator of Cu influx rate into the cytoplasm. A set of experiments was conducted on both untreated and Cu-depleted cells, before and after the enzymatic removal of surface PrPC. In the last case, cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered salt solution and then pre-incubated in serum-free medium containing 5 mU/cm2 phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from B. cereus (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2.5 h at 37C. Cells were dye-loaded as reported above and Cu transport assays performed by testing single extracellular Cu concentrations in separate experiments. The absolute Cu intake was computed as DFmax/F0 ratio, where DFmax is the maximum change in fluorescence observed after the addition of Cu to cells and F0 is the baseline signal, and expressed as a percentage of control. Data Analysis Results are presented as means  SE and each experiment has been done at least in triplicate. Statistical comparisons have been made by Students t test and ANOVA followed by Dunnetts post-test. Significance was demonstrated at p \ 0.05 (*). Results Trientine Effects on Cell Viability and Cu Status B104 cells were treated for 48 and 96 h with 0100 lM Trien alone and in combination with equimolar CuCl2, to consider a possible loss of cell viability due to the chelating agent self-toxicity. At the shortest treatment time, Trien did not show any toxicity per se even at the highest concentra- tion (dark bars in Fig. 1a). A slight toxicity, even if not significant, was observed after 96 h treatment with 25 lM Cu:Trien, not further exacerbated at 100 lM (Fig. 1b), to indicate that a prolonged exposure to this agent can slightly affect B104 cell viability independently on Cu chelation. When Trien was administered alone, a significant toxicity was detected only after 96 h treatment at concentrations equal or over 15 lM (Fig. 1b). To study the effects preco- ciously induced by Cu deficiency in B104 cultures, in the absence of events linked to a significant toxicity, we chose to test a condition preliminary to the loss of viability caused by 96 h treatment with 15 lM Trien. Studies were performed on cells cultured in the presence of 15 lM Trien for 48 h. We observe that Trien binds Cu2? ions selectively, but it also exhibits a lower affinity for Zn2? and Fe2?/3? ions. To assess if the selected experimental conditions could sig- nificantly deplete the intracellular pools of other ions than Cu, total amounts of Zn, Fe and Cu were quantified by AAS in lysates prepared from control and 48 h Trien- treated cultures. Total Cu levels appeared reduced by more 992 Cell Mol Neurobiol (2012) 32:9891001 123 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast than a half with respect to control condition (Table 2). Fe levels resulted slightly, but nonsignificantly reduced, while Zn content was substantially unchanged (Table 2). These findings were expected, since preliminary AAS evaluations on standard growth media (containing foetal bovine serum from different batches) indicated that Cu abundance is at least one order of magnitude lower than observed for Zn and Fe (10-1 vs. 10). We adopted a Trien concentration well below the values reported in most literature (Spisni et al. 2009; Lombardo et al. 2003; Rossi et al. 2001), and reasonably able to buffer the small amount of dissolved Cu ions, while being not enough to significantly chelate Fe and Zn. On the whole, cell viability assays and AAS data sup- ported the choice of Trien as a tool to reproduce Cu defi- ciency in vitro, in the absence of confounding effects due to the limited availability of other metal ions. Caspase-3 Activation The caspase-3 protease activity was measured as an indi- cator of the induction of mechanisms possibly leading to apoptosis in Cu-deprived B104 cells. Following exposure of cultures to 15 lM Trien for 48 h, a rise in the protease activity was detected (about 1.5-fold; p \ 0.05) (Fig. 2). The observation of treated cells by optical microscopy indicated that the initiation of cell death pathways was precocious with respect to the appearance of morphological changes typical of the apoptotic commitment, such as cell retraction and plasma membrane blebbing. A more in- depth investigation of cell morphology under Cu starvation was conducted by AFM. AFM Imaging Surface topographies were obtained from fixed cultures, showing the height variations and highlighting the fine features of surface morphology. Figure 3 clearly shows that Trien treatment modifies the cell shape, inducing control cells (a and b) to lengthen (c and d). To determine the Trien-treated cell size, we calculated the Feret diameter, defined as the average caliper distance of 36 measurements around the particle centre employing a 5 angle of rotation, and the R roundness factor, defined by the following formula: R  P2=4pA; where the object area A is defined by the number of pixels having intensity values within a selected range and the Fig. 1 Effects of Trien Cu chelating agent on B104 cell viability. MTT assays were performed on cultures treated with growing concentrations of Trien and Cu:Trien complex for 48 (a) and 96 (b) h.

Neuroblastoma cells were treated with 15 lM Trien for 48 h. Caspase-3 activation was evaluated on fresh cell homogenates by a colorimetric method based on the enzymatic cleavage of the chromogen substrate DEVD-pNA (kem 405 nm). The activity was graphed in terms of arbitrary units, assuming the control value as datum-point (1 a.u.). Results are the mean  SE of three separate assays (*p \ 0.05) Cell Mol Neurobiol (2012) 32:9891001 993 123 perimeter P is defined by the outline length of each particle. Smooth and round objects have a roundness factor close to 1 unity, while elliptical objects have roundness factors[1 as they are elongated (Nazar et al. 1996). The histograms in Fig. 3e show the roundness of untreated cells (light shaded) with respect to Cu-depleted ones (dark shaded). In both cases the histograms are fitted by a Gaussian profile (superimposed as a solid line). The roundness values that best interpolate the experimental data are 1.18  0.05 and 1.71  0.06 units for control and treated cultures, respectively. The nanomolar resolution AFM images in Fig. 3f, g evidently show that the surface of treated cells (g) exhibits a pronounced roughness with respect to untreated ones (f), demonstrating the alteration of cell molecular structures following Cu deprivation. For each condition, the AFM images were recorded from both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic regions of at least five cells. Gene and Protein Expression of Cu-Transporters Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was carried out to analyse the transcript content of the main Cu-transporters in Trien-treated B104 cells. Following normalization to GADPH, the relative mean expression rate of transcripts was compared between control and 48 h Cu-depleted cells. Fig. 3 Effects of Trien on cell morphological features.

Such result was highly reproducible, as confirmed by the low inter-assay variability, described by a coefficient of variation (CV%) ranging from 0.63 for 48 h treatment to 1.30 for control condition. In addition, a heavy effect on PrPC transcript content was observed. Data shown in Fig. 4a highlight that Cu deprivation resulted in a four-fold increase in transcript levels for the PrPC after Trien treatment (CV% 0.96). The protein amounts of Cu-transporters were deter- mined by immunoblot analysis. As pertains to CTR1 pro- tein, the antibody utilized in this study specifically detected a band with the apparent size of the trimeric form (127 kDa) (Fig. 4b), as revealed in other cell models and mammalian tissues (Kelleher and Lonnerdal 2006; Hard- man et al. 2006). The densitometric quantification indi- cated that the expression of CTR1 protein was unchanged in treated cells (Fig. 4c), although an activation of tran- scription was appreciable, evidencing the possibility that Cu can act as a post-translational modulator in mammalian cells. Western blot results did not show any substantial change in NRAMP2 and ATP7A protein synthesis by Cu- depleted cells (p [ 0.05; Fig. 4b, c). On the contrary, consistently with real-time PCR results, prion protein expression appeared to be up-regulated. An about 70% increase in PrPC expression with respect to control condi- tion was observed after treatment (p \ 0.01; Fig. 4b, c). Fig. 4 Analysis of the expression of Cu-transporters in Trien-treated B104 cells. a The real-time PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from control and Cu-deprived B104 cells demonstrated that PrPC and CTR1 mRNA levels are significantly increased following exposure to Trien for 48 h (*p \ 0.05; **p \ 0.01, ANOVA), whereas NRAMP2 and ATP7A mRNA levels are unaffected (*p [ 0.05). A quantitative measurement of the messenger expression ratio relative to untreated cells has been done for each gene using the Pfaffls formula. Data have been normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene Gadph and they are expressed as mean  SE from three separate experiments, each made in duplicate. b Protein extracts from treated cultures were subjected to western blot analysis to detect CTR1, PrPC, NRAMP2 and ATP7A proteins. Blots are representative of three separate assays. The mean protein abundances resulted unaffected for CTR1, NRAMP2 and ATP7A (p [ 0.05). A specific band of 30 kDa can be observed for prion protein, consistently more intense for treated samples (**p \ 0.01). c Variation in the amounts of proteins with Trien exposure (n = 3). Band intensities were quantified using Image J software Cell Mol Neurobiol (2012) 32:9891001 995 123 Cu Transport in Ion-Depleted Cultured Cells A kinetic study of Cu transport was performed on control and 48 h Trien-treated cultures by a fluorimetric method based on the Cu-sensitive probe Phen Green SK (Urso et al. 2010). The kinetic curve obtained for treated cells appeared sim- ilar to the control one and assimilable to a hyperbole (Fig. 5a), but the MichaelisMenten constant (Km) was heavily reduced and the maximal velocity (Vmax) significantly increased (see Table 3). The ion transport efficiency, calculated as Vmax/Km ratio, was almost four-fold higher in Cu-depleted cells if compared to untreated ones (see Table 3). To verify if other proteins than PrPC might account for the higher Cu uptake ability, the ion transport activity was measured in both control and Cu-depleted cells, after the enzymatic removal of surface PrPC molecules by PI-PLC. The histogram in Fig. 5b, referred to 0.8 lM extracellular Cu, is representative of all concentrations considered for the kinetic analysis, with slight quantitative variations. Under standard conditions, PrPC has been shown to be responsible for the 32.41  2.56% of the absolute Cu intake (see Ctrl and PLC bars, Fig. 5b). This value reflects the reduction of ion transport activity after the enzymatic removal of surface PrPCs (2 in Fig. 5b). After Trien treatment, the cell ability to import Cu ions has been demonstrated to be about double than normal (98.0  0.2% increase), and then it was ques- tioned if such variation was fully due to the observed con- sistent up-regulation of prion protein. When surface PrPC proteins were removed from Trien-treated cells by PI-PLC, the Cu transport activity was only 18.4  8.9% higher than observed in control cultures (3 in Fig. 5b), this reflecting the loss of ion transport activity through both basal and up-regu- lated PrPC. If the contribution of PrPC under basal conditions is subtracted from the whole PrPC-dependent component of transport (4 in Fig. 5b), it can be concluded that the increase of prion protein expression in Cu-deprived cells accounts for a 47.2  9.3% surplus of Cu uptake. Mechanisms associated to the (3) component of Cu transport activity in Trien and PI-PLC treated cells (-Cu, PLC bar, Fig. 5b) are PrPC-independent and cannot be deduced from this study. Dependence of SOD Activity on Prion Protein Expression We investigated whether the up-regulated PrPC in Cu- deprived cultures could influence the endogenous antioxi- dant buffer capacity, intended as SOD activity. When B104 cells were Cu-starved for 48 h, a half- reduced level of SOD activity was observed with respect to control cultures (Fig. 6a). To explore the ability of Trien- treated cells to balance their antioxidant defences, cultures were switched to Trien-free standard medium for up to 4 h (Fig. 6a, white bars). At the highest time point, the decreased enzyme activity resulted nearly fully restored (90.5  4.0% of control). When PrPC molecules were enzymatically cleaved from the surface of Cu-starved cells, the ability to recover SOD activity was compromised (Fig. 6a, grey bars). It was investigated if the PrPC-dependent recovery of cell SOD activity upon Cu replenishment was due to a protein inherent SOD-like function or to the enhanced Cu influx and loading of antioxidant enzymes. To this aim, Cu- deprived cells were exposed to CPZ and hypertonic sucrose, to prevent the PrPC-mediated uptake of Cu ions occurring through the clathrin-dependent endocytic path- way (Urso et al. 2010).

Experiments were repeated three times, with triplicates for each condition (mean  SE; *p \ 0.05) 996 Cell Mol Neurobiol (2012) 32:9891001 123 activity was calculated. In both cases, the enzyme activity was the same as detected in Trien-treated cells without switching to the standard medium (Fig. 6b). On the whole, these data indicate that the up-regulation of PrPC induced by Cu deficiency in B104 cells is aimed to increase the intake of Cu ions and indirectly sustains the Cu,Zn SOD activity. Discussion and Conclusions The implication of Cu in the pathogenesis of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases has become evident (Rivera- Manca et al. 2010; Waggoner et al. 1999; Zatta and Frank 2007). Cu deficiency is likely to trigger neurological dis- turbances and physical lesions characterizing neurodegen- eration (Zatta and Frank 2007), but the full comprehension of the molecular events underlying their onset has not been reached yet. In addition, a few studies have been dedicated to the role of Cu in modulating the transcriptional activities in cell cultures, under both ion deficiency and overload (Song et al. 2008, 2009; Muller et al. 2007; Ogra et al. 2006; Song and Freedman 2005; Tennant et al. 2002). Previous research on Cu-starved neuroblastoma cells privileged the link between the ion imbalance and the impairment of antioxidant cell activities, a risk factor for the onset of neurodegenerative disorders (Lombardo et al. 2003; Rossi et al. 2001). In this work, an in vitro analysis of neuron cell response to Cu deficiency was reported, with significant attention paid to the expression of Cu plasma membrane transporters and the oxidative status (antioxidant activity). A neuro- blastoma cell model, B104, was used, mimicking the physiological characteristics of neurons and expressing high levels of prion protein with a glycosylation pattern comparable to that of an adult brain (Monnet et al. 2003; Schubert et al. 1974). The cytosolic Cu pools have been depleted by treating cultures with the Cu chelating agent trientine, demonstrated to efficaciously stress the Cu- dependent cellular pathways (Spisni et al. 2009; Lombardo et al. 2003; Moriguchi et al. 2002; Zerounian and Linder 2002; Rossi et al. 2001; Yu and Wessling-Resnick 1998). Preliminary investigations showed a significant increase of caspase-3 activity in Cu-starved cells, indicating the activation of a cell death program through the induction of oxidative stress. In fact, among cysteine proteases, caspase- 3 enzymes have the heaviest impact when the ROS gen- eration exceeds the antioxidant cell defences (Jimenez Del Table 3 Kinetic parameters determined from Cu uptake curves in B104 cell model under control conditions and after 48 h Trien treatment Km (lM) Vmax (a.u. s -1 nr cells-1 10-5) Catalytic efficiency (a.u. s-1 nr cells-1 10-5/lM) Mean  SE Mean  SE Mean  SE Untreated 0.21  0.03 1.6  0.06 7.62  0.15 48 h Trien 0.06  0.01** 1.70  0.05* 28.33  0.17* The MichaelisMenten constant and the maximal velocity were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis with Graphpad Prism software version 5.0.

Values have been expressed as mean  SE of three measurements for each condition. **p \ 0.01 indicates a highly significant difference from control Cell Mol Neurobiol (2012) 32:9891001 997 123 Ro and Velez-Pardo 2004; Rossi et al. 2001; Matsura et al. 1999). Surprisingly, the nano-scale AFM images (Fig. 3) did not show any typical morphological signs of advanced apoptosis, as cell shrinkage and cytoplasmic blebbing. Cu-depleted cells generally appeared spindle-shaped and showed a marked plasma membrane roughness, not asso- ciated with changes in cell height (Fig. 3). This last mor- phological feature generally correlates with changes in the expression of surface proteins (Francis et al. 2009). Accordingly, the analysis of mRNA and protein abundance in treated B104 cells showed the heavy induction of a surface protein, PrPC, whose role as a cell adhesion mol- ecule could also explain the neurite outgrowth and cell elongation that we observed (Santuccione et al. 2005). A major section of this study centres on the transcrip- tional response activated by Cu starvation. As previously disclosed, a striking elevation of PrPC transcript and pro- tein levels has been evidenced in 48 h Cu-depleted B104 cells (Fig. 4), this indicating a significant involvement of prion protein in maintaining cell Cu homeostasis. Conflicting views coexist in the literature about the modulation of PrPC expression in response to an altered Cu availability. Varela-Nallar et al. (2006) documented the ability of Cu to reversibly induce the P-rnp gene expression in primary hippocampal and cortical neurons. Cultured fibroblasts with a genetic defect in Cu efflux have also been found to up-regulate the P-rnp gene expression under chronic Cu overload (Armendariz et al. 2004). On the contrary, the down-regulation of PrPC expression has been observed in Cu-treated hypothalamic neurons (Toni et al. 2005), meaning that the regulatory mechanisms depend on cell type. It is unlikely that cell- specific transcription factors are responsible for such variability, since those notoriously involved in P-rnp gene expression (Sp1, MTF-1, Ap-1, Ap-2, Atox-1) are ubiq- uitous (Bellingham et al. 2009; Mahal et al. 2001; Wright et al. 2009). Based on previous epigenetic studies (Cabral et al. 2002), a possible explanation could be that Cu deficiency acts in concert with unidentified cell-specific and ion-sensitive factors to disrupt the chromatin assem- bly and allow the accession of transcription factors to the P-rnp gene promoter. To explain the considerable increase of PrPC expression detected in Cu-deficient B104 cells, a compensatory role has been proposed for the up-regulated protein, aimed to restore the cell Cu status through the enhancement of PrPC- mediated ion intake processes. The ability of PrPC to promote Cu delivery is currently highly debated. PrPC has been reported to undergo endo- cytosis upon Cu binding (Perera and Hooper 2001; Pauly and Harris 1998; Brown et al. 1997a) and increase the cell Cu content in brain fractions (Brown 2003; Herms et al. 1999). However, in vitro studies demonstrated that PrPC functions as a Cu importer only under high ion concen- tration (Rachidi et al. 2003). Previous studies from our laboratory in B104 cell model upon physiological conditions gave a proof of a PrPC- dependent component of Cu intake through clathrin- dependent endocytosis (Urso et al. 2010). To investigate the function of PrPC upon Cu deprivation, the character- istics of Cu transport have been analysed in ion-depleted B104 cells. The 48 h trientine treatment, besides increasing the PrPC expression, resulted in an enhancement of cell transport activity, as confirmed by a nearly four-fold increase of the catalytic efficiency. The Km value deter- mined for Cu-deprived cells was significantly reduced (about 3.5-fold) and the maximal velocity increased by about 6% with respect to the control value, this indicating the presence of a greater number of Cu-transporters on the cell surface. Based on this experimental evidence and our previous work showing a role for PrPC in mediating Cu transport (Urso et al. 2010), the detected increase in the uptake activity has been supposed to be mainly dependent on a consistent contribution from surface prion proteins. Accordingly, when these proteins have been enzymatically released from Cu-depleted cells, the cell ability to bring Cu ions in was close to basal levels. An about 50% of surplus Cu intake has been estimated to be mediated by the up- regulated PrPC (Fig. 5). We have also considered the hypothesis that the newly synthesized prion protein up-regulates the activity of other proteins, like SODs, to balance the generation of ROS induced by Cu chelation (Lombardo et al. 2003; Rossi et al. 2001). Accordingly, the 64Cu loading and the enzymatic activity of Cu,Zn SOD from the brain of P-rnp0/0 mice result 10-50% reduced with respect to the wild-type genotype (Klamt et al. 2001; Brown and Besinger 1998; Brown et al. 1997b). The relationship between the expression of prion protein and the activity of the cuproenzyme Cu,Zn SOD has been re-examined in B104 cells upon Cu deprivation. The total SOD activity resulted half-reduced, as expected in con- sideration of the role of Cu as a Cu,Zn SOD cofactor. Based on literature evidences (Brown et al. 1997b, 1999, 2002), the overexpression of surface PrPC has been inter- preted as a cell adaptation strategy, functional to revert the impairment of Cu,Zn SOD activities. Accordingly, the up- regulated PrPC has been demonstrated to be responsible for the ability of Cu-starved cells to almost completely recover the SOD enzyme function upon re-exposure to standard growth conditions. The cleavage of surface prion proteins in treated cells made them unable to restore the SOD activity despite the availability of Cu ions (Fig. 6). It was questioned whether the uptake of Cu is a pre- requisite for the PrPC protective action against oxidative cell injury or this protein possesses a SOD-like activity. 998 Cell Mol Neurobiol (2012) 32:9891001 123 When the endocytosis phenomena were inhibited in Trien- treated cells, the up-regulated PrPC, even if in the presence of extracellular Cu, was not able to restore the basal SOD activity. This finding demonstrates that Cu-loaded PrPC has not an inherent antioxidant activity, but its neuroprotective action is due to the ion translocation into the cytosol. Here, Cu ions can act as cofactors in Cu,Zn SOD activation. The expression of CTR1 proteins has been also studied upon Cu starvation in B104 cultures. The protein abun- dance resulted unaffected, although the transcript was about doubled with respect to untreated cells, indicating the occurrence of post-translational control mechanisms. To our knowledge, in just a few cases it has been dem- onstrated in vitro that the levels of CTR1 transcript are inversely correlated to Cu availability (Song et al. 2008; Ricciardo et al. 2009). Most literature reports evidence that CTR1 is not subjected to transcriptional regulation in vitro (Hardman et al. 2006; Bauerly et al. 2004; Tennant et al. 2002). The CTR1-mediated Cu entry in mammalian cells is prevailingly controlled in a post-translational way, through the Cu-stimulated degradation of transporters (Nose et al. 2010; Petris et al. 2003; Tennant et al. 2002). The discrep- ancy between mRNA and protein levels emerging from this study could be explained by an increased sensitivity of CTR1 to proteasome degradation, as observed for CTR2 in the presence of the apo-ATOX1 form (Blair et al. 2010). As to NRAMP2, the unvaried levels of this transporter in Cu-starved cultures were unexpected, since this protein, recognized as a physiologically relevant Cu?-transporter (Arredondo et al. 2003), is known to be subjected to transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, variously operated by Fe, Zn and Cu ions (Arredondo et al. 2004; Tennant et al. 2002; Zerounian and Linder 2002; Martini et al. 2002; Yamaji et al. 2001; Yeh et al. 2000). The ATP7A protein content was also unchanged in response to Cu depletion, in agreement with most literature. In fact, the activity of this pump is notoriously regulated through events of intracel- lular protein relocalization. It is well-known that the ele- vation of intracellular Cu triggers the protein relocalization from the Trans-Golgi Network to the plasma membrane, where the ion excess is exported (Greenough et al. 2004; Petris et al. 2002). We observe that the experimental findings concerning CTR1 and NRAMP2 do not exclude that, where a Cu restriction should occur, CTR1 and NRAMP2 can play a role in the cell delivery of Cu ions. The affinities of CTR1 (Km 1-5 lM; Lee et al. 2002) and NRAMP2 (Zerounian and Linder 2002) would discourage such conclusion, unless other surface proteins close to these carriers are able to bind and locally concentrate the ion substrate. The up- regulated prion protein could hold this role by virtue of its high Cu-binding affinityfrom femtomolar to nanomo- larwithin the octameric N-terminal region (Thompsett et al. 2005). So, two steps can be hypothesized for the Cu ion translocation: first, prion proteins concentrate Cu ions within the endocytosis vesicles; second, Cu transport pro- teins with lower affinity on the walls of vesicles transfer ions into the cytosolic compartments (Salvato B., unpub- lished manuscript). If compared to literature, our results demonstrate that the transcriptional responses activated by cell Cu defi- ciency may depend on the specific cell type. Here, we mainly showed in a neuron-like cell model, overexpressing prion protein, that Cu deprivation triggers the transcrip- tional up-regulation of PrPC, playing a role in the modu- lation of Cu intake and the activation of cell antioxidant defences. We observe that a growing literature (see for a review Mehrpour and Codogno 2010) shows that the overexpression of prion protein is implicated in the malignant progression of many types of cancer. In the light of results presented in this article, the prion protein deposits could be interpreted as a molecular marker of a cell metal imbalance. Further work is evidently needed to clarify this issue, as well as the possible cooperation between prion protein and the other Cu transport systems in driving the cellular ion uptake under both standard and pathological conditions.
