Scharschmidt, MD A decade has passed since modern sequencing methods were first used to investigate the microbial communities present on healthy human skin.1,2 These studies of the skin microbiome, a term that broadly encompasses the skins resident microor- ganisms (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses) as well as their genomic content and meta- bolic byproducts, have illuminated the diversity of microor- ganisms inhabiting the skin surface and invigorated research aimed at understanding their contributions to human health and disease. Attention by the lay media highlighting these in- vestigations has heightened public awareness and interest in the human microbiome. In the clinic, this interest manifests as a wide range of patient inquiries regarding the role of mi- croorganisms in skin disease, the influence of prescribed thera- pies on the microbiome, and strategies or products to opti- mize skin flora for health or cosmesis. Satisfactory answers to these questions are still forthcoming and will likely prove highly nuanced based on the complexity and contextuality of the skin-microbiota relationship.3 The role of the skin microbiome in acne vulgaris is of par- ticular interest to patients, clinicians, and researchers. This in- terest stems in part from the long-standing view that Cutibac- terium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes has a causative role in acne pathogenesis and the efficacy of topical and oral an- tibiotics in acne treatment. Multiple studies have now used se- quencing-based methods to profile C acnes strains and the broader bacterial skin community associated with acne.4-6 Col- lectively, these profiles have highlighted qualitative shifts in skin microbiota, that is, altered metagenomic content or meta- bolic activity indicated by specific subsets or ribotypes of C acnes that appear to be associated more with acne risk than overall C acnes abundance.7 In this issue of JAMA Dermatology, Chien et al8 report re- sults of a small pilot study profiling the facial skin microbi- ome of 4 women with acne prior to and following treatment with oral minocycline. Analysis of surface swabs of the bilat- eral forehead, cheek, and chin were performed at baseline, af- ter completion of a 1-month minocycline course, and 1 and 8 weeks after completion of the course of antibiotics. Bacterial taxonomic assignment was performed by amplification and se- quencing of V3/V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ri- bosomal gene. As in prior studies2,4-6 of sebaceous skin sites in both healthy participants and those with acne, Chien et al8 found that C acnes constituted a large proportion of the facial microbiome. Both at baseline and throughout the sampling pe- riod, composition of samples from a given participant were most similar to each other compared with those from a differ- ent participant. This is consistent with data showing that as- pects of the skin microbiome are highly individualized and that specific strains may persist on a given person for months to years.9 Within a given participant, dynamic shifts in bacterial com- munity composition were observed across the 4 time points, Related article page 425 Editorial Opinion jamadermatology.com (Reprinted) JAMA Dermatology April 2019 Volume 155, Number 4 419  2019 American Medical Association.

Pooled analysis of samples from all 4 participants demon- strated a roughly 25% reduction in relative abundance of C acnes immediately following the course of oral minocy- cline. This reduction persisted at 1 week but was largely re- versed at 1 month posttherapy. Importantly, minocycline was also associated with sustained decreases in the relative abun- dance of several other bacterial genera, that is, Corynebacte- rium, Prevotella, and several Lactobacillus species, as well as temporary or sustained increases in others (several Pseudo- monas species and Streptococcus species respectively). As the authors correctly point out, the small sample size, the lack of an untreated control arm, and the omission of mock sampling controls represent considerable limitations10 that re- strict the generalizability of their studys findings. However, the longitudinal sampling constitutes a strength of the study and yields interesting, albeit preliminary, insight into the in- fluence of a commonly used therapeutic intervention. Stud- ies that use this design provide distinct and complementary information to those studies that investigate disease- associated microbial communities at a single time point. Al- though the reduced abundance of C acnes following minocy- cline therapy is expected based on prior studies using conventional culture11 or 16S sequencing,12 the short- and lon- ger-term alterations in other bacterial genera are intriguing and may help explain complications of antibiotic treatment for acne vulgaris such as gram-negative folliculitis and pharyngitis. It will be important to determine whether future investi- gations describe similar shifts in bacterial community com- position in response to minocycline or other acne treatments and whether these changes correlate with the clinical re- sponse described by Chien et al.8 It will also be powerful to pair this type of longitudinal, interventional study design with metagenomic and proteomic assays to detect altered func- tional capacity of the skin microbiome, such as prevalence of specific C acnes ribotypes, pathogenicity islands, and pro- duction of related products. Independent of disease status, this study contributes to a small, but growing amount of literature addressing composi- tion and resilience of the skin microbiome in response to an- timicrobial agents. Recent examination of the short-term ac- tion of topical antiseptics on the back and forearm of 13 healthy participants revealed that the treatment effects depended heav- ily on the initial composition of the bacterial microbiome, a highly personalized and body sitespecific feature.13 Simi- larly, baseline differences in the microbiome composition of the 4 individuals evaluated by Chien et al8 may have contributed to the distinct trajectories of the bacterial com- munities, as measured by alpha diversity, following minocy- cline treatment. Future longitudinal studies should incorporate analysis al- gorithms and sample size calculations that account for these person-specific differences in skin bacterial community com- position. Studies of the long-term treatment effects of oral an- tibiotics on the gut microbiome have documented changes in bacterial community structure and the prevalence of antibi- otic resistance genes that persist for months following therapy. Recovery of composition of the gut community is further im- paired with repeated antibiotic courses.14 Whether oral anti- biotics have a comparably enduring influence on the skin mi- crobiome remains to be determined. Short-term changes to the skin microbiome structure and function are likely not limited to a response to antimicrobial agents. Indeed, just as gut microbial communities are influ- enced by diet (eg, low vs high fiber), so is skin microbial ecol- ogy likely influenced by agents that affect factors accounting for age- and site-specific differences in skin microbiome, such as sebaceous content, salinity, pH, and moisture.15 Any topi- cal or oral treatment that alters these parameters and the skin microbial community might mitigate or promote disease de- pending on the context. Although the prospect of studying the entire array of prescribed, over-the-counter and lightly regu- lated or unregulated skin products is daunting, we might pri- oritize for study those products that result in a sustained ben- efit in a relevant disease context, such as isotretinoin in acne. How can we address our patients questions regarding the skin microbiome? I believe we can be enthusiastic about the potential of microbial-derived or microbial-directed thera- pies as future weapons in our therapeutic arsenal while ac- knowledging that there is much we still do not understand about the influence of current therapies on the delicate sym- biosis we maintain with our cutaneous microbiota. In the con- text of a growing market of over-the-counter products de- signed to restore the skin microbiome, we should further emphasize that there is no universally good or bad skin mi- crobiome. Microbes have highly contextual roles in skin biol- ogy, and a variety of factors, including the hosts genetics, might influence whether a given strain contributes to host health or exacerbates a disease state.3 As a specialty, continued basic re- search as well as translational studies, such as those high- lighted here, place us on a strong trajectory toward decipher- ing these complexities.

Frieden, MD In this issue of JAMA Dermatology, Jeon and colleagues1 re- port on the safety and efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) use in the treatment of port-wine stains (PWS) in a cohort of nearly 200 infants treated without the use of general anesthesia. The authors retrospectively ana- lyzed photographs from short-term follow-up and found a high rate of excellent clearance and no major cutane- ous adverse events. They emphasize the feasibility of treat- ing young infants without general anesthesia, an approach that is increasingly relevant because of recent concerns raised about possible developmental effects of general anesthesia in chil- dren younger than 3 years. Although the authors treatment approach is similar to ours in many respects, there are several aspects of their study that are worthy of further discussion. We base our comments on published literature on this topic as well our experiences as pediatric dermatologists with a busy laser practice that has used PDL for PWS treatment since 1989 (in the case of the senior author). Concerns regarding associations of general anesthesia use with brain and neurocognitive development in young infants have recently been emphasized.2 In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration and the International Anesthesia Research So- ciety convened a diverse group of experts and issued a con- sensus statement on the use of anesthetic and sedative drugs in infants and toddlers.3 This statement emphasized avoid- ance of elective and repeated general anesthesia in young in- fants, a caution that is highly relevant for the treatment of PWS with PDL. There is broad consensus that PDL is a painful procedure and increases in pain as PWS size increases because more pulses are required. Although Jeon and colleagues acknowledge this as an issue, they also note that dynamic cooling devices, which spray a cryogen prior to the laser pulse, significantly dimin- ish pain during PWS treatment.1 We agree that dynamic cool- ing devices may reduce pain, but they certainly do not elimi- nate it. Pain experienced during infancy has been shown to have both short-term and potentially long-term effects, in- cluding possible effects on the developing neural circuitry that result in long-lasting differences in pain perception.4,5 For ex- ample, higher numbers of same-day preschool vaccines have recently been shown to contribute to needle phobia in school- aged children and adolescents.6 Even though the short-term or long-term effects of repeated PDL treatment on emotions and pain perception have not been studied systematically, we cannot assume that there is no effect. The patients in the study by Jeon and colleagues1 received an average of 10 treatments. Although all patients started treatments before 1 year of age, the mean age at initiation was 3.38 months, so some of these patients continued treatment into the second year after birth. Our own experience is that by age 12 to 15 months, many in- fants show signs of fear and struggle more with laser treat- ments, particularly if multiple treatment sessions have al- ready occurred. In considering infant reactions to PDL, the total number of treatments is also worthy of discussion. Some authors have found that the degree of PWS improvement with PDL treat- ment diminishes after an average of 5 treatments,7 whereas the mean number of treatments in the study by Jeon and colleagues1 was 10. It would be helpful to know, either in this cohort or in future studies, how much additional benefit ac- crues with each additional treatment, particularly in infants receiving more than 5 to 10 treatments. Of note, the authors treated eyelid PWS in awake infants after inserting metal eye shields. A supplementary video shows this being done fairly easily in a young infant for a very brief period of time.
