Nguyen, MD, MS; Xiaobin Zheng, MD; Yikyung Park, ScD; Edward L. Giovannucci, MD, ScD; Charles E. Matthews, PhD; Graham A. Colditz, MD, DrPH; Yin Cao, MPH, ScD IMPORTANCE Prolonged sitting, particularly watching television or videos, has been associated with increased risk of multiple diseases and mortality. However, changes in sedentary behaviors over time have not been well described in the United States. OBJECTIVE To evaluate patterns and temporal trends in sedentary behaviors and sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates in the US population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A serial, cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) among children aged 5 through 11 years (2001-2016); adolescents, 12 through 19 years (2003-2016); and adults, 20 years or older (2003-2016). EXPOSURES Survey cycle. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for 2 h/d or more, computer use outside work or school for 1 h/d or more, and total sitting time (h/d in those aged 12 years). RESULTS Data on 51 896 individuals (mean, 37.2 years [SE, 0.19]; 25 968 [50%] female) were analyzed from 2001-2016 NHANES data, including 10 359 children, 9639 adolescents, and 31 898 adults. The estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for 2 h/d or more was high among all ages (children, 62% [95% CI, 57% to 67%]; adolescents, 59% [95% CI, 54% to 65%]; adults, 65% [95% CI, 61% to 69%]; adults aged 20-64 years, 62% [95% CI, 58% to 66%]; and 65 years, 84% [95% CI, 81% to 88%] in the 2015-2016 cycle). From 2001 through 2016, the trends decreased among children over time (difference, 3.4% [95% CI, 11% to 4.5%]; P for trend =.004), driven by non-Hispanic white children; were stable among adolescents (4.8% [95% CI, 12% to 2.3%]; P for trend =.60) and among adults aged 20 through 64 years (0.7% [95% CI, 5.6% to 4.1%]; P for trend =.82); but increased among adults aged 65 years or older (difference, 3.5% [95% CI, 1.2% to 8.1%]; P for trend =.03). The estimated prevalence of computer use outside school or work for 1 h/d or more increased in all ages (children, 43% [95% CI, 40% to 46%] to 56% [95% CI, 49% to 63%] from 2001 to 2016; difference, 13% [95% CI, 5.6% to 21%]; P for trend <.001; adolescents, 53% [95% CI, 47% to 58%] to 57% [95% CI, 53% to 62%] from 2003 to 2016, difference, 4.8% [95% CI, 1.8% to 11%]; P for trend =.002; adults, 29% [27% to 32%] to 50% [48% to 53%] from 2003 to 2016, difference, 21% [95% CI, 18% to 25%]; P for trend <.001). From 2007 to 2016, total hours per day of sitting time increased among adolescents (7.0 [95% CI, 6.7 to 7.4] to 8.2 [95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4], difference, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7 to 1.5]) and adults (5.5 [95% CI, 5.2 to 5.7] to 6.4 [95% CI, 6.2 to 6.6]; difference, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.7 to 1.3]; P for trend <.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nationally representative survey of the US population from 2001 through 2016, the estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for at least 2 hours per day generally remained high and stable. The estimated prevalence of computer use during leisure-time increased among all age groups, and the estimated total sitting time increased among adolescents and adults.

Indeed, the second edi- tion of the seminal 10-year update of the Physical Activity Guide- lines for Americans8 not only acknowledged the health risks associated with sedentary behaviors but also, for the first time suggested that most people would benefit from both increas- ing moderate to vigorous physical activity and reducing time spent sitting.9 However, the second edition of the Physical Activity Guide- lines for Americans9 does not prescribe a quantitative key guide- line for sitting time. Trends in sedentary behaviors remain poorly described in the US population. Increased screen time has been reported in children,10 but findings among adoles- cents are mixed.11,12 Analyses among adults have not re- ported trends over time13 or were limited by the use of regional data.14 A recent analysis of 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data suggested that 25.7% of US adults reported more than 8 hours of total sit- ting time per day, yet the report utilized a single cross- sectional sample.7 Because the pattern of sedentary behav- iors varies substantially by age, comprehensive temporal trend analysis across major age groups utilizing nationally repre- sentative data would be essential for the development of age- specific public health campaigns or programs. In addition, so- ciodemographic and lifestyle correlates of prolonged sitting have not been systematically evaluated in the population. To address these, trends in sedentary behaviors among the US population were examined, overall and according to socio- demographic and lifestyle characteristics, utilizing data from the NHANES. Methods Study Population The NHANES, described in detail elsewhere,15 has since 1999 surveyed a nationally representative, complex, stratified, mul- tistage probability sample of the civilian noninstitutional- ized US population continuously in 2-year cycles, including a household interview and a physical examination in a mobile examination center. The NHANES obtained approval from the National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board, and participants provided written consent. In the pre- sent study, age groups were defined as children 5 through 11 years, adolescents 12 through 19 years, and adults 20 years or older.16 Information on sociodemographic characteristics, weight and height, lifestyle, and sedentary behaviors was com- bined into a single data set for each data cycle from the 2001- 2002 to 2015-2016 cycles, while excluding those who were younger than 5 years (due to unavailable sedentary behavior measure) or living with physical function limitations (de- fined as crawl, walk, run, or play limitations for children and adolescents; and difficulty walking for a quarter mile or walk- ing up 10 steps for adults).16 Trends in screen-based seden- tary behaviors were presented using estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for 2 h/d or more and com- puter use outside school or work for 1 h/d or more from 2001 through 2016 in children and from 2003 to 2016 for adoles- cents and adults. Trends in total sitting time were presented from 2007 through 2016 for adolescents and adults. All trends were examined by sex, race/ethnicity, annual household in- come, weight status, leisure-time physical activity, and edu- cational attainment and smoking status (adult only). Assessment of Sedentary Behaviors Screen-based sedentary behaviors, including time spent sit- ting watching television or videos and computer use outside school or work were assessed using 2 consistent questions for children (cycle 2001-2002 to 2015-2016; reported by parents) and adolescents and adults (cycle 2003-2004 to 2005-2006, and 2011-2012 to 2015-2016) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). They were asked, (1) Over the past 30 days, on average, how many hours per day did [you/childs name] sit and watch television or videos? and (2) Over the past 30 days, on average, about how many hours per day did [you/childs name] use a com- puter or play computer games outside of school or work? with options of none, less than 1 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, or 5 hours or more per day. Because of the categorical nature of these data, for primary analyses, participants re- sponses were further categorized into less than 2 vs 2 h/d or more for sitting watching television or videos and less than 1 vs 1 h/d or more for computer use. These cutoffs, previously used in other studies,17,18 also approximated the median val- ues in the present study population. Both the NHANES ques- tions have shown evidence of test-retest reliability in measur- ing television or video watching (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.32) and computer use (intraclass correlation co- efficient, 0.69) in the US adult sample.19 In addition, similar questions assessing parental reports of childrens television watching and computer use have yielded high reliability co- efficients (intraclass correlation or Pearson r ranged from 0.60 Key Points Question What were the levels and changes of sedentary behaviors among the US population from 2001 through 2016? Findings In this serial cross-sectional study that included 51 896 participants, the estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos at least 2 h/d was high in 2015-2016 (ranging from 59% to 65%); the estimated prevalence of computer use outside school or work for at least 1 h/d increased from 2001 to 2016 (from 43% to 56% for children, from 53% to 57% among adolescents, and from 29% to 50% for adults); and estimated total sitting time increased from 2007 to 2016 (from 7.0 to 8.2 h/d among adolescents and from 5.5 to 6.4 h/d among adults). Meaning In the US population, sedentary behaviors generally remained stable and high or increased from 2001 through 2016, depending on the specific activity.

Total sitting time was assessed among adolescents and adults, but not children, from the 2007-2008 cycle through the 2015-2016 cycle. Participants were asked (in a typical week), how much time (minutes) do you usually spend sitting (or reclining) on a typical day (including time spent sit- ting at a desk, sitting with friends, traveling in a car or bus, or train, reading, playing cards, watching television, or using a computer)? Responses were converted to hours per day.19 A similar total sitting question: During the last 7 days, how much time did you usually spend sitting on a week-day/ weekend day? was used in the International Physical Activ- ity Questionnaireand has been validated (criterion validity Spearmans  >0.45) in the US adult sample with high repeat- ability (test-retest Spearman  >0.71).21 Participants who reported more than 16 hours (approximately the average waking hours per day)13 of daily total sitting time were con- sidered implausible values and were excluded. Assessment of Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Characteristics Self-reported sociodemographic characteristics included sex, annual household income (<$25 000, $25 000-$74 999, and $75 000), and educational attainment (< high school, high school, and >high school for adults only). In addition, prior research demonstrated distinct patterns according to racial/ethnic group in television watching behavior among children and adolescents22,23 and in total sitting time among adolescent and adults.13 In the present analyses, race/ ethnicity were defined as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other (includes races other than non- Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic, including multiracial)16 according to participant self-report (proxy reported for children and adolescents aged 5-16 years). Weight and height were measured during the physical exami- nation at the mobile examination center, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Among children and adoles- cents, BMI-to-age percentile cutoffs (Center for Disease Con- trol and Prevention) were used: normal (5th-84th percentile), overweight (85th-94th percentile), and obese (95th percentile).24 For adults, BMI was classified into normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), and obese (30.0). Underweight participants (<5th percentile for children and adolescents and <18.5 for adults) were excluded due to potential underlying health conditions. Leisure-time physical activity was assessed using separate questions within each age group. Childrens leisure-time physical activity was defined using a binary variable dichotomized by cycle- specific median cutoffs to represent inactive and active, respectively. Among adolescents and adults, no vs any mod- erate or vigorous physical activity at leisure time was used to define inactive vs active participants. Smoking status was assessed in adults only, as never, former, or current smokers (eMethods in the Supplement). Statistical Analyses Survey analysis procedures were used to account for sample weights, stratification, and clustering of the complex sam- pling design to ensure nationally representative estimates.15 Estimates on crude weighted prevalence and 95% CIs of sit- ting watching television or videos (2 h/d) and computer use outside school or work (1 h/d), and crude weighted means and 95% CIs of total sitting time (h/d) were calculated by cycle and age group. Crude linear trends in sedentary behav- iors were evaluated using linear regression models across survey cycles and to estimate regression coefficients () and 95% CIs for every 2-year change. P for trends were estimated using the survey cycle as a continuous variable. Absolute dif- ferences in the estimated prevalence of screen-based behav- iors were calculated by comparing the 2015-2016 cycle with the corresponding baseline cycle (children, 2001-2002; ado- lescents and adults, 2003-2004). Among adolescents and adults, the absolute difference in total sitting time (h/d) between the 2015-2016 and 2007-2008 cycles was calcu- lated. Additionally, crude trends in screen-based sedentary behaviors (3 and 4 h/d for television or video and 2 and 3 h/d for computer) were visually illustrated. Logistic regressions were used to model prevalence of screen-based behaviors and estimate odds ratios (ORs), while linear regressions were used to model total sitting time and es- timate regression coefficients to evaluate age-adjusted, and multivariable-adjusted linear trends. Sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates for sedentary behaviors over time were iden- tified using multivariable regression models adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, weight, annual household income, leisure- time physical activity for all participants and educational at- tainment and smoking status for adults. Individuals with miss- ing covariates were excluded, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using indicators for missingness. Overall and race/ ethnicityspecific predicted margins on the prevalence or means were estimated for each cycle standardizing to the joint sample distribution of the model covariates. Due to insuffi- cient sample size, the race/ethnicity category other (other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic) was excluded in subgroup analyses. Similarly, due to the small number of adults 65 years or older, their trends in sedentary behaviors were presented separately from younger adults (20-64 years) but grouped together in multivariable regres- sion models. All statistical tests were 2-sided and statistical sig- nificance was set at P < .05. P values were not adjusted for mul- tiple testing and should be interpreted as exploratory. Data were analyzed using Stata version 14.0 (Stata Corp). Results After excluding 669 underweight participants (1.2%), 3720 (6.5%) with limitations on physical function, 718 (1.3%) with missing data on sedentary behavior, and 61 (0.1%) with re- ported total sitting time longer than 16 h/d, a total of 51 896 Trends in Sedentary Behavior Original Investigation Research jama.com (Reprinted) JAMA April 23/30, 2019 Volume 321, Number 16 1589  2019 American Medical Association.

The sample size per cycle ranged from 1139 to 1430 children; 1097 to 1990 adolescents; and 4008 to 4724 adults. Unweighted sample sizes in the 2015-2016 cycle overall and for each age group by sociodemographic and life- style characteristics are presented in Table 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement. For the weighted sample size, see eTable3 in the Supplement. Participants with missing covariates (12.4% children, 14.0% adolescents, 12.4% adults) were excluded in the multivariable analyses. Screen-Based Sedentary Behaviors Sitting Watching Television or Videos In the 2015-2016 cycle, a substantial proportion of the popu- lation spent at least 2 h/d sitting watching television or vid- eos. The estimated prevalence among children was 62% (95% CI, 57% to 67%); adolescents, 59% (95% CI, 54% to 65%); adults overall, 65% (95% CI, 61% to 69%). Among adults aged 20 to 64 years, the estimated prevalence was 62% (95% CI, 58% to 66%) and among those 65 years or older, 84% (95% CI, 81% to 88%; Table 2), with a large proportion spending 2 to 3 h/d (Figure 1).

Compared with the 2001-2002 or 2003-2004 cycles, the 2015-2016 estimated prevalence of sitting watching televi- sion or videos (2 h/d) was stable over time among adoles- cents (P for trend = .60) and adults 20 years or older (P for trend = .38), primarily among younger adults aged 20 through 64 years (P for trend = .82). For prevalence estimates, see Table 2; for sample size, see eTable 3 in the Supplement. In chil- dren, a statistically significant decline was noted since 2001 (P for trend = .004). However, this decline was driven largely by a decrease among non-Hispanic white children (P for trend = .01). For prevalence estimates, see Figure 2 and eTable 4 in the Supplement. In contrast, a significant increase ap- peared in adults older than 65 years (P for trend = .03). For prevalence estimates see Table 2. Overall and racial/ethnic specific estimated prevalence and trends remained similar af- ter age and multivariable adjustment. For overall and racial/ ethnicspecific prevalence estimates and P for trend values, see eTable 5 in the Supplement. Significantly higher estimated prevalence was consis- tently observed across all ages after multivariable adjustment among males, non-Hispanic black, obese, or physically inac- tive participants. Compared with females, the OR for boys aged 5-11 years was 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01-1.26); for boys aged 12-19 years, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.02-1.34); and for adult men, 1.14 (95% CI, 1.06-1.23). Compared with their non-Hispanic white counterparts, the OR for non-Hispanic black children was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.56-2.09); for non-Hispanic black adolescents, 1.64 (95% CI, 1.39-1.94); and for non-Hispanic adults, 1.63 (95% CI, 1.43-1.86). Compared with their normal-weight counterparts, the OR for obese children was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.32-1.90); for obese adolescents, 1.80 (95% CI, 1.45-2.22); and for adults who were obese, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.43-1.76). Compared with their physically active counterparts, the OR for inactive chil- dren was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.45); for inactive adolescents, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.00-1.53); and for adults who were inactive, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.25-1.48) (Table 3 and Figure 2). Additionally, children and adults from lower-income families tended to watch more television or videos (both P for trend <.005). For comparative absolute prevalence estimates in the 2015- 2016 cycle, see eTable 6 in the Supplement, and the esti- mated ORs and P for trends for the 2015-2016 cycle, see eTable 7 in the Supplement.

Among them, the majority used a computer for 1 to 3 hours daily (Figure 1). Overall, outside school or work, 30% to 43% of the US population used a computer for 2 h/d or more, and 13% to 25% used a computer for 3 or more hours each day. In contrast to the generally stable trends in sedentary television or video viewing time, computer use outside school or work (1 hour/d) significantly increased among all age groups from 2001 or 2003 to 2016 (for prevalence esti- mates, see Table 2; for sample size, see eTable 3), primarily driven by the increasing proportion of the population that used 2 h/d or more (Figure 1). The estimated prevalence of 1 h/d or more of leisure-time computer use increased from 43% (95% CI, 40% to 46%) to 56% (95% CI, 49% to 63%) between 2001 and 2016 for children (P for trend <.001; dif- ference, 13% [95% CI, 5.6% to 21%]). Between 2003 and 2016, the estimated prevalence of computer use outside school or work of 1 h/d or more increased from 53% (95% CI, 47% to 58%) to 57% (95% CI, 53% to 62%) for adolescents (P for trend = 0.002; difference, 4.8% [95% CI, 1.8% to 11%]). Among adults, the estimated prevalence increased from 29% (95% CI, 27% to 32%) to 50% (95% CI, 48% to 53%) between 2003 and 2016 (P for trend <.001; difference, 21% [95% CI, 18% to 25%]), with a greater increment among those 65 years or older, from 15% (95% CI, 12% to 19%) to 53% (95% CI, 46% to 61%, P for trend <.001) for a difference of 38% (95% CI, 31% to 45%). Age and multivariable adjust- ment revealed similar overall and racial/ethnic-specific trends of computer use (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Correlates of higher estimated prevalence of computer use outside school or work (1 h/d) were noted with less consis- tent patterns across age groups over time (for estimated ORs and P for trend, see Table 3; for 2015-2016 cycle, see eTable 7 in the Supplement). For instance, males of all ages, children who were non-Hispanic black, children and adolescents who were physically inactive, adolescents and adults with higher BMI, and adolescents from families with higher household in- come reported higher estimated prevalence of computer use (for estimated ORs and P for trend, see Table 3; and for the 2015- 2016 cycle, see eTable 7 in the Supplement). Total Sitting Time From 2007 to 2016, the crude total sitting time increased in both adolescents and adults (P for trend <.001 for all). Total sitting time increased from 7.0 to 8.2 h/d among adolescents (difference, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7 to 1.5]), from 5.5 to 6.5 h/d among younger adults (difference, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.3]), and from 5.3 to 6.1 h/d among older adults (difference, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.3]) (Table 2, for sample size see eTable 3 in the Supple- ment). Overall and racial/ethnic trends in total sitting time re- mained significant after multivariable adjustment (P for trend <.001 for all) (eTable 8 in the Supplement). Prolonged total sit- ting was observed in adults with higher household income, educational attainment, or BMI (for coefficients and P values for each variable see eTable 9 in the Supplement, and for the 2015-2016 cycle see eTable 10 in the Supplement). Discussion In this nationally representative sample of the US popula- tion, the estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for 2 h/d or more remained high and stable from 2001 through 2016, except for a decline in non-Hispanic white chil- dren and an increase in adults 65 years or older. Meanwhile, the estimated prevalence of computer use during leisure time of 1 h/d or more significantly increased among all age groups with more pronounced increase among adults. Between 2007 and 2016, the estimated total sitting time increased by nearly 1 h/d among adolescents and adults. Although these trends were comparable among most subgroups, males, non- Hispanic blacks, obese or physically inactive individuals re- ported significantly higher estimated prevalence of pro- longed sitting watching television. In 2018, the Global Action Plan on Physical Activity (2018- 2030) for the first time adopted sedentary behavior reduc- tion as one of the strategies for global chronic disease preven- tion and control.25 The second edition of Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans published in November 2018 fur- ther highlighted several knowledge gaps for making specific recommendations to reduce sedentary behaviors and its as- sociated health risks.8 In particular, understanding the land- scape of sedentary behaviors is a critical step before population- wide strategies can be developed and implemented. Although increases in leisure screen-time and sedentary time spent in occupation and commuting have been documented in parts of Europe and Australia,26-28 US-based studies have thus far been limited to children,10 with smaller and inconsistent re- ports among adolescents.11,12 The majority of data among adults have utilized a single cross-sectional sample13,18,29,30; thus, trends in US sedentary behaviors have not been well de- scribed. Present analyses provide a contemporary understand- ing of sedentary behaviors across all age groups in the United States from 2001 to 2016. Although the estimated prevalence remained generally stable, 60% of the US population spent 2 h/d or more sitting watching television, which is comparable with a recent cross- sectional report from the American Time Use Survey.31 For all ages, substantially higher prevalence of sitting watching tele- vision or videos was observed among male, non-Hispanic black, obese, or physically inactive individuals. A few prior reports have noted that TV watching was more common among children who were non-Hispanic black or obese,23,32 and for black adolescents.22 In line with these findings, dif- ferences according to sex, race/ethnicity, weight status, and physical activity levels were consistent not only over time but also from early childhood through late adulthood. Because television viewing, the most well-studied sedentary behavior, was associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases3,5 and all-cause mortality,5 these observed differ- ences in television viewing time across the life course may Trends in Sedentary Behavior Original Investigation Research jama.com (Reprinted) JAMA April 23/30, 2019 Volume 321, Number 16 1595  2019 American Medical Association.

Additional studies are warranted to further understand whether certain groups with prolonged sitting may be affected disproportionally. Of note, the substantial rise in total sitting time among ado- lescents and adults appears to be attributable to sedentary be- haviors other than television or video watching, which was likely driven in part by the observed increases in computer use. Although patterns were less consistent, persistent sociode- mographic and lifestyle correlates of computer use appeared since early childhood. Taken together, these findings strength- ened the case for understanding patterns of early childhood sedentary behaviors, the trajectory of sitting behaviors across the life course, and their influence on disease outcomes.35 The studys strengths include the utilization of a large, na- tionally representative survey with a rigorous protocol and ex- tensive quality control, the investigation into trends of both screen-based sedentary behaviors and total screen time, and the thorough examination of potential sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates. Limitations This study has several limitations. First, self-reported seden- tary behaviors may not reflect the true amount of sitting. Nevertheless, self-reported television or computer time and total sitting time have been widely used in epidemiological studies,3,5,19 and measurement errors were unlikely to affect findings on the secular trends over time. Additionally, esti- mates on television and computer time were comparable with cross-sectional reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics American time use survey,31 and the total sitting time was simi- lar to that estimated using accelerometry in a prior NHANES study (7.7 h/d).13 Second, sedentary time using other devices such as phones and tablets were not captured. However, the NHANES questionnaire specifically asks about time sit[ting] and watch[ing] TV or videos, which may at least partially cap- ture video watching time on personal devices as these behav- iors became more ubiquitous. In fact, the majority of na- tional surveys36 and large epidemiological studies5 have not yet assessed sedentary time spent on handheld devices. Nev- ertheless, present conservative estimates have revealed sub- stantial increment in total sitting time over the years. Addi- tionally, reading on a computer may have substituted for reading a book; thus, computer use may have captured the reading time that was previously spent reading books, which was sedentary as well. Third, NHANES was not able to sepa- rate sitting playing computer video games from those with a physical activity component. However, based on limited re- ports from the industry, only 8% to 18% (among different demographic groups) of the US population are regular gam- ers with 48% of all gamers dedicated to console rather than computer gaming.37 Hence, assessing time spent on com- puter use may misclassify related sedentary time but to a mini- mal extent. Altogether, measuring and understanding the shift in sedentary behaviors and their contributions to disease risk are critical and urgent in reducing the progressive increase in the early-onset of multiple chronic illnesses38,39 as well as dis- parities nationwide. Conclusions In this nationally representative survey of the US population from 2001 through 2016, the estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for at least 2 hours per day gen- erally remained high and stable. The estimated prevalence of computer use during leisure-time increased among all age groups, and the estimated total sitting time increased among adolescents and adults.
