Liver-Related Deaths in Persons Infected With the Human Immunodeficiency Virus: The D:A:D Study ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION Liver-Related Deaths in Persons Infected With the Human Immunodeficiency Virus The D:A:D Study The Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs Study Group* Background: An increasing proportion of deaths among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infected per- sons with access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are due to complications of liver diseases. Methods: We investigated the frequency of and risk fac- tors associated with liver-related deaths in the Data Col- lection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs study, which prospectively evaluated 76 893 person-years of fol- low-up in 23 441 HIV-infected persons. Multivariable Poisson regression analyses identified factors associated with liver-related, AIDS-related, and other causes of death. Results: There were 1246 deaths (5.3%; 1.6 per 100 per- son-years); 14.5% were from liver-related causes. Of these, 16.9% had active hepatitis B virus (HBV), 66.1% had hepa- titis C virus (HCV), and 7.1% had dual viral hepatitis co- infections. Predictors of liver-related deaths were latest CD4 cell count (adjusted relative rate [RR], 16.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1-31.7 for 50 vs 500/ L), age (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4 per 5 years older), in- travenous drug use (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4), HCV in- fection (RR, 6.7; 95% CI, 4.0-11.2), and active HBV infection (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.4-5.9). Univariable analy- ses showed no relationship between cumulative years pa- tients were receiving cART and liver-related death (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.07). Adjustment for the most re- cent CD4 cell count and patient characteristics resulted in an increased risk of liver-related mortality per year of mono or dual antiretroviral therapy before cART (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.16; P=.008) and per year of cART (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.21; P=.02). Conclusions: Liver-related death was the most fre- quent cause of nonAIDS-related death. We found a strong association between immunodeficiency and risk of liver- related death. Longer follow-up is required to investi- gate whether clinically significant treatment-associated liver-related mortality will develop. Arch Intern Med. 2006;166:1632-1641 M ORTALITY AMONG HU-man immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV)infected persons livingin resource-rich coun- tries has declined from 20 to 30 per 100 person-years before 1995, when combi- nation antiretroviral therapy (cART) be- came available, to 2 to 5 per 100 person- years in recent years.1,2 Nevertheless, mortality rates remain high relative to un- infected persons, even in settings with ac- cess to therapy.3-5 The risk of death from AIDS may be related to therapeutic fail- ure,6 late initiation of cART,7 interrup- tion or refusal of cART, incomplete ad- herence, or drug resistance. More than 50% of all deaths in HIV- infected persons receiving cART are now from causes other than AIDS.2,8-10 An in- creasing proportion of deaths are the re- sult of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections and in- travenous drug and alcohol use. In addi- tion, there is an increasing awareness of the potential toxic effects associated with prolonged cART. Although some adverse effects (eg, lactic acidosis) are now rarely observed owing to avoidance of specific drug combinations,11,12 long-term toxic ef- fects possibly resulting from mitochon- drial toxicity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease have emerged.12-14 The effect of any cART-induced hepato- toxicity15-18 on the risk of liver-related mor- tality remains to be determined. We in- vestigated the causes and frequency of death in a large multicenter cohort of HIV- infected individuals and assessed the re- lationships between liver-related deaths and HIV-associated immunodeficiency, HBV and HCV coinfections, and cART. *Authors/Writing Committee: The authors/writing committee for the D:A:D Study Group are listed at the end of this article.

Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ by a New York University User on 05/04/2019 METHODS DESIGN The Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study is a collaborative, observational study of 11 co- horts that includes 23 441 HIV-1infected persons prospec- tively followed up at 188 clinics in Europe, the United States, and Australia.19 The study began in December 1999, and the latest follow-up for this analysis is February 2004. Although the primary end point of the study is myocardial infarction, other end points, including all deaths, are prospectively collected. De- tails of quality assurance, governance, and sponsorship have been published elsewhere.14 DATA COLLECTION All the participants were under prospective follow-up in their individual cohorts at the time of enrollment in the D:A:D study. Standardized data collection forms containing sociodemo- graphic, clinical, laboratory, and comprehensive antiretrovi- ral and other medication information are completed at each site annually. Results of HBV and HCV serologic and viral load as- sessments, if available, have been collected since January 1, 2004 (including previously collected data by the participating co- horts). Information on cause of death was collected using a case report form and was reviewed and coded centrally at the study coordinating office. END POINTS Deaths were classified as liver related if clinical or autopsy di- agnoses described hepatic failure (regardless of etiology), hepa- tocellular carcinoma in patients with end-stage liver disease, esophageal or other bleeding in the presence of end-stage liver disease, assumed medication-related hepatotoxicity resulting in hepatic failure without evidence of other etiologies of hepatic fail- ure, or acute hepatic failure after acute bacterial or opportunis- tic infection in patients with previously known end-stage liver disease. Deaths due to opportunistic infections or malignancies according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defi- nition of clinical AIDS were classified as AIDS related. The cat- egory non-AIDS malignancies excluded AIDS-defining and hepatitis virusassociated malignancies. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All the analyses were based on calculations of the incidence rate, defined as the number of deaths divided by the total person- years of follow-up. Follow-up began at enrollment in the D:A:D study and ceased on the date of death, February 1, 2004, or 6 months after the patients last cohort visit, whichever came first. Each persons follow-up was divided into a series of consecu- tive 1-month periods, and his or her status regarding each ex- planatory variable was determined at the start of each month. Explanatory variables considered were sex, cohort, HIV trans- mission group, ethnicity (all fixed covariates that remained un- changed), age, body mass index, family history of cardiovas- cular disease, smoking status, previous cardiovascular event, HCV status (negative: seronegative, or seropositive but HCV RNA negative; positive: seropositive and HCV RNA positive or HCV RNA unknown; or not tested), HBV status (positive: ac- tive infection [HB surface antigen, HB e antigen, or HBV DNA positive]; positive: inactive infection [HB surface antigen nega- tive, antiHB e antibody positive, or HBV DNA negative]; vac- cinated: antiHB surface antigen positive only; or not tested), latest available CD4 cell count, latest available HIV RNA level, and calendar year (all time updated so that the value used was that from the beginning of the month in question rather than that from the time of D:A:D enrollment). Poisson regression models were used to quantify the relationship between each factor and the rate of death from each cause. Each cause of death was modeled separately in all the analy- ses, and, therefore, the characteristics of patients dying of each cause were compared with those of all other patients in the co- hort (including those dying of other causes). To rule out the pos- sible competing effects of death from another cause, all the analy- ses were repeated after excluding from each those who died of other causes (eg, for analyses of the factors associated with liver- related deaths, individuals dying of AIDS-related and other causes were excluded). The conclusions remained unchanged. To investigate the relationship between increased expo- sure to cART and liver-related deaths, we initially fitted a uni- variable Poisson regression model with cART categorized as 0, less than 1, 1 to less than 2, 2 to less than 3, 3 to less than 4, 4 to less than 5, 5 to less than 6, and 6 or more years, and then years of cART was considered as a continuous covariate. Sub- sequent analyses controlled for time-updated exposure to mono or dual antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated before cART, the nadir CD4 cell count (and all other variables described previ- ously), and then the latest CD4 cell count. The nadir CD4 cell count, the latest CD4 cell count (both after log2 transforma- tion), and the latest HIV RNA level (after log10 transforma- tion) were included as continuous covariates in these analy- ses. Additional analyses considered cumulative exposure to cART and liver-related mortality after stratifying by the latest CD4 cell count and the patients HCV status and after lagging the CD4 cell count by 3 or 6 months (ie, taking the CD4 cell count value for any 1 month as the value held 3 [or 6] months ago rather than the latest value). RESULTS PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS We followed up 23 441 persons for a median of 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 3.1-3.8 years; 76 893 person- years of follow-up). Follow-up on 20.8% of the partici- pants was censored 6 months after their last cohort visit. At enrollment in the D:A:D study, participants had a me- dian age of 39 years (range, 34-45 years), and 24.1% were women. The median nadir CD4 cell count before enroll- ment was 200/L (range, 1-2580/L), and clinical AIDS had been diagnosed in 26.4% of the participants. A total of 22.5% of the patients were HCV positive, and 6.8% had active and 21.4% had inactive HBV infection. Hepa- titis C virus positivity and active HBV infection were found in 1.6% of the patients. By February 1, 2004, 88.7% of the patients had received cART (median, 4.5 years; range, 2.3-6.3 years), of whom 48.1% had received mono- therapy or dual combination therapy before initiating cART; 4.4% of the patients had received therapy with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors only, either as monotherapy or dual therapy or as part of triple nucleo- side reverse transcriptase inhibitor combinations. MORTALITY AND LATEST CD4 CELL COUNTS A total of 1246 persons (5.3%) died (incidence, 1.62 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53- (REPRINTED) ARCH INTERN MED/ VOL 166, AUG 14/28, 2006 WWW.ARCHINTERNMED.COM 1633 2006 American Medical Association.

The most common causes of death were AIDS (31.1% of deaths; incidence, 0.51 per 100 person-years), liver- related diseases (14.5% of deaths; incidence, 0.24 per 100 person-years), cardiovascular or other heart diseases (11.0% of deaths; incidence, 0.18 per 100 person-years), and non- AIDS malignancies (9.4% of deaths; incidence, 0.15 per 100 person-years); 33.8% of deaths were from other causes (incidence, 0.55 per 100 person-years). In the 1246 patients who died, the latest CD4 cell count before death was less than 50/L in 24.5% and less than 200/L in 54.2%. The latest CD4 cell count was mea- sured a median of 10.7 weeks (IQR, 5.3-18.4 weeks) be- fore death (in those with a latest CD4 cell count 200/ L, the assessment was a median of 10.1 weeks [IQR, 5.3- 18.3 weeks] before death, and in those with a latest CD4 cell count of 200/L, the assessment was 11.1 weeks [IQR, 5.1-18.6 weeks] before death). We found a strong relationship between the degree of cellular immunode- ficiency and AIDS-related, liver-related, and all other deaths (Table 1). CLINICAL PRESENTATION We observed 181 liver-related deaths: 87 (48.1%) in pa- tients with CD4 cell counts less than 200/L and 94 (51.9%) in those with CD4 cell counts of 200/L or greater. Autopsy results were available for 9.8% of these patients. The characteristics of persons who died are given in Table 2. Individuals who died of liver-related causes were more likely to have acquired HIV infection by in- travenous drug use and were more likely to have docu- mented HCV coinfection or active HBV coinfection or HCV and active HBV coinfection. The median nadir and latest CD4 cell counts of patients dying of liver-related causes were higher than those of patients dying of AIDS. Although a smaller proportion of patients had started cART with a low CD4 cell count, a greater proportion had received monotherapy or dual therapy before cART. They were equally likely to be receiving treatment with an undetectable HIV RNA level at the time of death. Re- ported diagnoses at the time of death are summarized in Table 3. There were no differences in the characteris- tics of liver-related deaths between patients with CD4 cell counts less than 200/L vs 200/L or greater. RISK FACTORS There was a strong relationship between immunodefi- ciency and liver-related death after adjusting for other po- tential confounding variables (adjusted relative rates [RRs] of 16.06, 11.54, 7.14, 3.95, and 1.67 for those with latest CD4 cell counts of 50, 50-99, 100-199, 200-349, and 350- 499/L, respectively, compared with CD4 cell counts 500/ L) (Figure 1). Other independent predictors of liver- related death were older age (adjusted RR per 5 years, 1.32), HIV acquisition via intravenous drug use (adjusted RR, 2.01), HCV infection (adjusted RR, 6.66), and active HBV infection (adjusted RR, 3.73). When the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level were in- cluded in the model as continuous variables, a 2-fold lower CD4 cell count was associated with a 23% increased risk of liver-related death (adjusted relative hazard per 2-fold lower CD4 cell count, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.29; P.001), and each log higher HIV RNA level was associated with an increased risk of 27% (relative hazard, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.43; P.001). The effects of other factors in the model were unchanged after including the variables in this way. A total of 578 patients (2.5%) had started HCV treat- ment, and 20 735 patients (88.5%) had used 1 of the 3 ART drugs (lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil, or adefo- vir dipivoxil) also active against HBV infection. Sensi- tivity analyses adjusting for specific treatment of HCV or HBV infection did not substantially change the fac- tors observed in the main model.

They are included in the overall analysis but are not included in any analyses in which the CD4 cell count is included as a factor.

Univariable analyses con- firmed that there was no relationship between cumula- tive cART and liver-related deaths either overall (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.07 per year of exposure; P=.93) or in CD4 cell count (200/L: RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.96-1.20; P=.20; 200/L: RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.08; P=.66) or HCV (negative: RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.12; P=.85; positive: RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92-1.10; P=.82) strata. Adjustment for time-updated antiretroviral mono- therapy or dual therapy initiated before cART, the nadir CD4 cell count (as a continuous log2-transformed vari- able), and other clinical and demographic variables (Figure 1) modified the relationship with cART slightly (Table 4). Adjustment for the latest CD4 cell count, which allows for study of the effect of cumulative cART over and above any positive effects of cumulative cART on CD4 cell counts, resulted in an increased risk of liver- related mortality with longer exposure to cART (1.11; P=.02) The use of mono or dual ART before cART was associated with an increased risk of liver-related deaths, but adjustment for this variable did not modify the re- lationship between cART and liver-related deaths. COMMENT In this large prospective study, we found that AIDS- related disease still accounted for most deaths (31.1%), and liver disease was the most frequent non-AIDS related cause (14.5%). There was a strong association be- tween immunodeficiency and an elevated risk of liver- related and other non-AIDSrelated deaths. Other strong Table 2.

Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ by a New York University User on 05/04/2019 associations with liver-related deaths were intravenous drug use, HCV infection, and active HBV infection. Many patients in the D:A:D study who died had initiated mono- therapy or dual therapy at a time when cART was not available. Only a few of those who died had never re- ceived cART. Liver-related deaths are largely a consequence of chronic HBV or HCV coinfection,9,10,20-24 although the association between HCV coinfection and increased mortality has not consistently been identified.25,26 More than 76% of the liver-related deaths in the present study were associated with infection with either HBV or HCV. Infection with HIV accelerates the progression of HCV disease to cirrhosis presumably by increasing hepatitis C viremia.27,28 Conversely, HCV may adversely affect HIV infection and reduce the effectiveness of cART,29 although this remains controversial.30,31 Whereas HBV infection increases liver-related mortality in coinfected persons, it does not seem to affect the progression of HIV or the response to cART.23 Antiretroviral therapy has been reported to reduce liver-related mortality in HCV-coinfected persons,32 but we found no such effect. In the present cohort, 2.7% of all liver-related deaths were reported to be directly associated with antiretrovi- ral medication. The link with acute hepatotoxicities for some antiretroviral drugs is an undisputed but infre- quent cause of mortality.15,16 In contrast, the possible long- term adverse effects of cART on hepatic function are con- troversial,15,17 although a recent study33 found a 12% increase in liver-related deaths per year of cART. Medi- cation-associated hepatotoxicity may be more frequent in HCVcoinfected persons.15,34 The present results do not allow us to reach firm conclusions about any rela- tionship between prolonged cART and liver-related death. Because a higher CD4 cell count is associated with a lower rate of liver death, cART might affect the liver death rate in at least 2 ways: (1) by increasing the CD4 cell count, and thus reducing the death rate and (2) by increasing the death rate due to putative long-term hepatotoxicity. 1001010.2 1001010.2 1001010.2 Latest CD4 Cell Count, L Age Risk Group Body Mass Index Smoking Status Previous CVD HCV Status HBV Status <50 50-99 100-199 200-349 350-499 <18 18-26 26-30 >30 per 5 y Homosexual Heterosexual IDU Other Current Ex Never Unknown Negative Negative Positive, Inactive Positive, Active Vaccinated Not Tested Positive Not Tested No Yes 500 AIDS Related Liver Related All Other Causes Relative Rate of Death Figure 1.

Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ by a New York University User on 05/04/2019 This analysis, which assessed the relationship between cumulative cART exposure and the liver death rate with- out accounting for follow-up CD4 cell counts, suggests no association. Thus, if either of the 2 possible effects is operating, then it may be negated by the other. In con- trast, adjusting for the latest CD4 cell count, which can be interpreted as showing the remaining relationship be- tween cART duration and liver-related mortality after the positive effects of therapy have been removed, showed an 11% (95% CI, 2%-21%; P=.02) increased rate of liver- related death per year of cART. Thus, there may be nega- tive effects of cART on the liver in addition to the posi- tive effects acting via CD4 cell count increases. However, the residual relationship was relatively modest and of bor- derline statistical significance, so it is difficult to rule out confounding. The use of mono or dual ART before cART was also an independent factor seen among liver-related deaths, but adjustment for this variable did not modify the relationship between cART and liver-related deaths. This finding, however, might suggest that the pro- longed use of reverse transcriptase inhibitors is a risk fac- tor for hepatotoxicity. Further follow-up and increasing numbers of liver-related deaths are needed before the mechanisms behind our results can be clarified. Although it has been recognized that HIV infection considerably accelerates the progression of HCV dis- ease,27 we were surprised to find such a strong relation- ship between liver-related deaths and cellular immuno- deficiency. Although HIV replication was also predictive of these deaths, more than half of those who died of liver disease had undetectable viral loads at the time of death. A similar relationship between immunosuppression and poorer outcome is also seen in HIV-uninfected, HCV- infected liver transplant recipients: more intense post- transplantation immunosuppression, following the use of corticosteroids and antiproliferative agents, leads to increased graft failure and progression to cirrhosis.35 In these patients, treatment for rejection has been associ- ated with diminished survival in HCV-infected but not HCV-seronegative recipients.36 The present study has notable strengths, in particu- lar its large size, broad geographic area, inclusion of a A 10.0 0.1 1.0 0.01 0 <1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 5-6 >6 cART Duration, y De at h Ra te >200/L<200/L B 10.0 0.1 1.0 0.01 0 <1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 5-6 >6 cART Duration, y De at h Ra te HCV NegativeHCV Positive Figure 2.

Nonetheless, some specific causes of death are still too infrequent to permit an analysis of risk factors. In line with all clinical studies, only a small proportion of pa- tients underwent autopsy after death, and many pa- tients died outside a medical institution, hampering as- sessment of causes of death. Moreover, information on alcohol intake was not routinely available and could not be considered, although it is an important risk for liver disease.37 There are a variety of clinical implications of these find- ings.

These findings suggest that the effect of immunodeficiency on the risk of these types of death remains present even in patients with CD4 cell counts of 200 to 500/L. Future studies should explore the possible benefits and risks of starting ART at CD4 cell counts higher than currently recommended in pa- tients with a known risk of liver-related death. Second, the question of if and when to treat hepatitis co- infections must consider the status of liver disease and the immune status. Third, treatment or prevention of il- licit drug and alcohol use is particularly important in HCVcoinfected persons because these risks are associ- ated with accelerated progression to liver cirrhosis.

Liver diseases, mainly due to hepatitis virus in- fections, accounted for almost 15% of the deaths and were strongly associated with advanced immunodeficiency. There was no definite relationship between mortality and ART. The possibility of increased medication-related mor- tality cannot be excluded, but the CD4 cell count in- creases with cART seem to balance any adverse effects that exist. Combination ART has substantially im- proved the outcomes of HIV-infected persons with ac- cess to care.1,3-5 However, long-term studies of large co- horts are crucial for the systematic collection and analyses of clinical end points to investigate the relationships be- tween immune function and end-organ failure8,38 and to recognize novel and late-emerging treatment-related toxic effects.
