Targeted UV-B Phototherapy for Plaque-type Psoriasis STUDY Targeted UV-B Phototherapy for Plaque-type Psoriasis Pravit Asawanonda, MD, DSc; Akkrawat Chingchai, MD; Pawinee Torranin, MD Objective: To determine whether targeted UV-B pho- totherapy is efficacious and safe in the treatment of lo- calized psoriasis and whether there is a dose-response re- lationship. Design: Randomized, evaluator-blind, controlled study. Setting: Dermatology clinic in a large university-based hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Patients: Fourteen patients with stable, localized, plaque- type psoriasis. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive dif- ferent fluences of targeted UV-B phototherapy 3 times weekly based on predetermined minimal erythema doses (MEDs). Treatment fluences were constant throughout the study period of 4 weeks. Follow-up was carried out until lesions returned to original state. Main Outcome Measures: Modified psoriasis area and severity index. Results: All fluences of UV-B produced some clinical im- provement and were very well tolerated. Fluences rang- ing from 1 to 6 multiples of MEDs resulted in clearance of lesions in some patients with 6 MEDs producing clear- ance in 77% of patients. The number of treatments re- quired to clear psoriatic lesions when 2 to 6 MEDs were used was 5.0 to 6.1 treatments. The only adverse events observed were erythema, which was asymptomatic in most subjects, and hyperpigmentation. Conclusions: Incoherent, targeted UV-B phototherapy is a safe and efficacious treatment modality for localized psoriasis. Its value in other UV-B responsive conditions should be further investigated. Arch Dermatol. 2005;141:1542-1546 P ARRISH AND JAENICKE 1 DEMON- strated that the action spec- trum for psoriasis clearing lies within the 300- to 313-nm range. Based on that conclu- sion, phototherapy using longer wave- lengths of UV-B has been developed. For more than a decade now, narrowband UV-B phototherapy emitting light in the 311- to 313-nm spectra has been used success- fully for the treatment of psoriasis. This is associated with more effective clearing of psoriasis compared with conventional broadband UV-B. However, the normal, un- involved skin is unavoidably exposed to UV radiation, resulting in several adverse ef- fects. It is also known that psoriatic plaques can tolerate higher fluences of UV radia- tion, compared with uninvolved skin.2 Most recently, efforts have been made to de- velop therapeutic devices that deliver light, be it laser or incoherent, selectively to the psoriatic plaques. The use of 308-nm excimer laser to spe- cifically treat psoriatic lesions has been re- ported since 1997.3 Since that time several other studies with modifications of proto- cols appeared in the literature, confirming theusefulnessof this treatmentmodality.4-9 However, the excimer machine is rather costly; thus, a more economical device may be more suitable for use in the less devel- oped nations. Our study objectives were to determine whether the use of the high- intensity, broadband UV-B device would result in clinical improvement and to de- termine the number of treatments and doses of UV-B needed to improve local- ized psoriatic plaques. METHODS PATIENTS Patients 18 years or older with stable, plaque- type psoriasis, who had not received any sys- temic therapies, including photochemo- therapy for the past 8 weeks and topical treatments or UV-B phototherapy within the past 4 weeks, were eligible for the study.

Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, lactation, and photo- sensitive disorders. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital/ Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. Informed con- sent was obtained from each participant. PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE The irradiation source used in this study, DuaLight (Thera- Light Inc, Carlsbad, Calif ), was a high-pressure mer- cury lamp capable of emitting either UV-B or UV-A. The UV-B spectral output of this light source includes peaks at 302 nm and 312 nm, with an average weighted ery- themal wavelength of 304 nm. The high output of this device allows irradiation of 100 mJ/cm2 of UV-B to take place within approximately 0.7 second. UV radiation is delivered through a square aperture sized 1.91.9 cm. TECHNIQUE Prior to the start of the study, minimal erythema dose (MED) was determined on each subject using un- tanned, uninvolved skin of the buttocks or the lower back. The dose ranges were dependent on skin types, namely 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 mJ/cm2 for skin type III and 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, and 270 mJ/cm2 for skin type IV. If no erythema developed, the doses were fur- ther increased, so that the MED could be detected in all subjects. Treatment was delivered 3 times per week for 4 weeks or until lesions cleared. Patients were then fol- lowed up every 4 weeks until lesions returned to their baseline state. The first treatment was started in Octo- ber, and the last follow-up was in February of the fol- lowing year. Doses of UV-B used for the treatment were 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 multiples of MED. Fluences of UV-B delivered to each spot remained constant throughout the study. Mapping of lesions was performed using clear plastic sheets to ensure that the following doses were delivered to the very same areas treated previ- ously. If blistering developed, treatment was to be with- held until reaction subsided. An untreated plaque in the same area served as control. EVALUATION OF EFFICACY Psoriasis severity index (PSI) scores, also known as modified PASI scores, which took into account ery- thema, induration, and scaliness of the plaques,4,7 were given at baseline and every 2 weeks of treatment by an investigator blinded to the dose assignment (P.A.). Scores of 0 to 4 were assigned to each of the 3 clinical aspects; thus, the maximum score possible was 12. Clearance was defined as greater than 95% improve- ment. Photographs were taken at each visit. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) software. Repeated-measure analysis of variance was used to determine the overall treatment effect. RESULTS A total of 14 patients (10 men and 4 women), whose ages ranged from 23 to 53 years, were enrolled in the study. Only 1 patient failed to complete the study because her psoriasis flared up and oral methotrexate was pre- scribed. Of the remaining 13 patients who completed the study, 4 were of skin type III, while the other 9 were of skin type IV. Table 1 gives the characteristics of pa- tients who completed the study. The body surface area involved in each patient was less than 10%. The mean PSI score of the 13 patients at baseline was 7.38, with a range of 3 to 10. Minimal ery- thema doses for patients with skin type III ranged from 90 to 240 mJ/cm2, while those of skin type IV ranged from 120 to 390 mJ/cm2. All fluences produced some clinical improvement. Pso- riasis severity index scores improved in 12 subjects. Only 1 subject (patient 9) had worsening of the treated plaques. This is probably because his psoriatic lesions elsewhere Table 1.

Also of note is that the assigned plaques of this patient were located on the lower leg, an area notoriously recalcitrant to most forms of treatment. Figure 1 shows the PSI scores at baseline, at weeks 2 and 4, and at 4-week follow-up, which clearly demon- strate a dose-response relationship. The mean PSI score at 2 weeks for all UV-B doses combined was 3.37 (range, 0-10). At 4 weeks, this mean global score was further reduced to 3.01 (range, 0-10). Compared with controls, no statistically significant improvement was seen at any time points when 0.5 to 1.0 MED fluences were used (Table 2). Fluences ranging from 2 to 6 MEDs produced statistically significant improvements when compared with controls at 2 weeks (P=.002 for 2 MEDs; P.001 for 4 and 6 MEDs). These significant improvements were maintained at week 4 (Table 2). However, when mean PSI scores obtained from 1, 2, 4, and 6 MEDs were compared, there were no statistically significant differences among the doses (data not shown). The average total number of treatments and cumula- tive doses of UV-B received by patients for each particu- lar dose are outlined in Table 3. A fluence of 0.5 MED did not clear any psoriatic plaques. Fluences as low as 1 MED were able to clear psoriasis at some time points in 3 patients and 2 MEDs cleared 5 le- sions, while 4 MEDs cleared 7 lesions. As expected 6 MEDs, the highest fluence, cleared the most lesions (ie, 10 plaques) (Table 4). The mean number of treat- ments necessary to clear psoriasis was lowest for 2 MEDs. However, this is not significantly different from fluences of 4 and 6 MEDs, for which 5.71 and 6.10 treatments, re- spectively, were needed (Table 4). The clearing of psoria- sis following this treatment, unfortunately, is followed by rapid relapse. Most psoriatic plaques returned to their origi- nal state within 4 weeks after treatment was discontin- ued. Only in 2 patients were remissions maintained past 4 weeks at doses at or above 2 MEDs. Adverse effects observed were limited to asymptom- atic erythema at higher fluences and hyperpigmenta- tion in some patients. Interestingly, painful erythema, but not blistering, was seen in 2 subjects. This was seen only when treatment was delivered to the elbow area and not elsewhere on the body. 8 7 6 2 3 4 5 1 0 Time of Observation M ea n PS I S co re Baseline 2 Weeks 4 Weeks 4-Week Follow-up Control 2 MEDs 1 MED 6 MEDs 0.5 MED 4 MEDs Figure 1.

Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ by a New York University User on 05/04/2019 COMMENT High-dose UV-B phototherapy, whether delivered by la- ser or broadband light source, seems promising in the treat- ment of localized, recalcitrant psoriatic lesions. The higher fluences delivered through these devices result in fewer numbers of treatments compared with the conventional stand-up units used in most centers. Another major ben- efit from such treatment lies within the fact that only pso- riatic lesions are treated. Thus, normal skin is not at in- creased risk of developing photoaging or skin cancers. We have demonstrated that using higher fluences of broadband UV-B, psoriasis can be cleared even with the darker skin types. Similar to previous studies using 308-nm excimer laser, UV fluences less than 6 multiples of MED can be safely delivered without causing any significant pho- totoxic effects. Recently, Trehan and Taylor5 reported that medium dose excimer laser delivered 3 times weekly re- sults in clearance of psoriasis, defined as greater than 95% improvement, after a mean of 10.6 treatments and mean cumulative dose of 6.1 J/cm2. When higher doses of ex- cimer laser, namely, 8 and 16 times the MED, were used, as few as 1 treatment may clear psoriasis.6 In a multicenter study involving 116 evaluable pa- tients, Feldman et al7 found that 72% (66 of 92) of the participants who completed the 10 treatments as planned or had clearance before the 10 treatments could achieve at least 75% clearance after an average of 6.2 treatments, and 35% (28 of 80) of the participants achieved at least 90% clearance by 7.5 treatments. With Kaplan-Meier analy- sis, Feldman et al7 concluded that the median time to achieve 75% improvement was 8 treatments. Overall, 84% of patients reached improvement of 75% or better after 10 or fewer treatments; 50% of patients reached improve- ment of 90% or better after 10 or fewer treatments.7 The results from our study are similar to the afore- mentioned excimer studies in that patients who re- ceived comparable doses of UV light, between 2 and 6 MEDs, cleared after receiving 5 to 6 treatments (Table 4). This has been confirmed in a study published recently in which Tanghetti and Gillis9 demonstrated equivalent outcomes when excimer laser was compared with inco- herent UV-B light source. However, a direct compari- son regarding cumulative UV doses cannot be made be- cause the dosimetry for excimer laser and incoherent UV-B light is different. Given the now wider varieties of avail- able high-intensity light sources, it might be more logi- cal to compare in terms of equi-erythemogenic doses, for instance, multiples of MEDs. The therapeutic effect of targeted UV-B phototherapy should be similar to that of broadband UV-B,10 narrow- band UV-B,11 and 308-nm excimer laser,12 whereby apop- tosis of infiltrating lymphocytes and reduction in prolif- eration of keratinocytes are the main mechanisms of action. One major advantage of the device used in our study is the ease and efficiency for MED determination, which takes less than a minute. After that, UV-B fluences in the multiples of MEDs can be delivered in a reasonable time similar to excimer laser. Moreover, as mentioned by Tan- ghetti et al,9 the beam profile is more uniform than that of excimer laser, making treatment in tile mode much easier to perform. This results in very homogeneous clear- ance of lesions (Figure 2). The remission time obtained in the present study is rela- tively short, with most patients having a relapse within 4 weeks of the last treatment. This might have resulted from the fact that our study time was limited to 4 weeks as op- posed to 8 weeks in other studies5 because we believe that for a novel phototherapy/laser device to appeal to pa- tients with psoriasis, it needs to produce more rapid im- provement compared with the median time of 40 days for clearing psoriasis that one gets with narrowband UV-B.13 Trehan and Taylor5 reported a mean remission time of 3.5 months after an 8-week course of medium-dose excimer laser treatment. For the high-dose excimer laser treat- ments, nearly half the treated subjects could maintain re- mission for more than 4 months after a single treatment.6 In the multicenter study by Feldman,14 data from the par- ticipants who cleared and were available for follow-up re- vealed a median remission time of 8.7 weeks.14 We strongly believe there are several modifications that may improve the therapeutic outcomes; for instance, it would be inter- esting to see whether use of higher fluences at longer in- tervals will result in improved remission time. Also, Tre- han and Taylor6 demonstrated that induration and scaliness of lesions are more important predictors of outcome than erythema. In fact, basing the dose purely on induration of the lesions has proved very effective in the treatment of recalcitrant localized psoriasis.8 We did not observe any serious adverse events asso- ciated with this treatment modality. In fact, most pa- tients tolerate the light doses very well. Only mild burn- ing sensation at the higher fluences was observed. Bullae, which occurred with excimer laser treatment, even at me- dium doses,5 were not observed in our study. However, long-term safety of such high-dose irradiation is diffi- cult to predict at the moment. It is well accepted that sun- burn,15,16 especially in the earlier years of life, is associ- ated with the development of melanomas in later years. Extended follow-up is thus warranted. In summary, targeted UV-B phototherapy is a safe and convenient way to deliver light specifically to psoriatic le- sions and will be of great benefit to patients who have lo- calized, recalcitrant disease for which other conventional treatments have failed. Also, it may be useful for psoriasis 2 MEDs 4 MEDs 6 MEDs Figure 2. Clinical improvement observed at different fluences (4 weeks). MEDs indicates minimal erythema doses.

The other indications for which targeted UV-B phototherapy may be used should be similar to those for excimer laser, namely, vitiligo,18-20 eczema, mycosis fungoides, and theoretically intraoral lesions such as oral lichen planus. In fact, after submission of this manuscript, we have had success with some patients with patch-stage mycosis fungoides. Accepted for Publication: December 1, 2004.
