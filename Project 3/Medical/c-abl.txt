Previous studies indicated that the ubiquitous expression of c-Abl tyrosine kinase transduces a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic cellular signals. In this study, we demonstrated that a synthetic neuro- toxic prion fragment (PrP106-126) activated c-Abl tyrosine kinase, which in turn triggered the upregulation of MST1 and BIM, suggesting the activation of the c-Abl-BIM signaling pathway. The peptide fragment was found to result in cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction in neuron cultures. Knockdown of c-Abl using small interfering RNA protected neuronal cells from PrP106-126-induced mitochondrial dys- function, production of reactive oxygen species, and apoptotic events inducing translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Blocking the c-Abl tyrosine kinase also prevented neuronal cells from PrP106-126-induced apo- ptotic morphological changes. This is the first study reporting that c-Abl tyrosine kinase as a novel upstream activator of MST1 and BIM plays an important role in prion-induced neuron apoptosis via mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings suggest that c-Abl tyrosine kinase is a potential therapeutic target for prion disease. Keywords Priondiseases .c-Abltyrosinekinase .PrP106-126 . Mitochondrial dysfunction . Cell death Introduction Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform en- cephalopathies (TSEs), are caused by infectious amyloid fi- brils and pathologically characterized by brain vacuolation, neuronal cell death, and microgliosis [13]. The disease oc- curs in humans as Kuru, CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and Gerstamann Straussler Sheinker syndrome (GSS), in cattle as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and in sheep and goats as scrapie [4]. The main event associated with the pathogenesis of prion diseases is the conversion of the normal cellular prion proteins (PrPC) to the misfolded isoform PrPSc [5, 6]. The accumulation of Bo Pan and Lifeng Yang contributed to this work equally. B. Pan : L. Yang : J. Wang :Y. Wang : J. Wang :X. Zhou :X. Yin : D.

The neurotoxic PrP fragment 106-126 (PrP106-126) pos- sesses similar physicochemical and pathogenic properties to PrPSc, in that it forms amyloid fibrils with a high -sheet content, shows partial proteinase K resistance, and is neuro- toxic in vitro. Therefore, PrP106-126 is commonly used as a model system to study prion-induced neurodegeneration [814]. Oxidative stress has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disor- ders. It occurs when there is an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease in antioxidant levels. Increasing evidence suggests that an increase in free radical production due to a decrease in mitochondrial antioxidant defense is responsible for damages in the brain of prion-infected animals and may contribute to the development of prion diseases [15]. Evidence of apoptosis was demonstrated in vivo in the brain of scrapie-infected sheep [16], in mice, and hamsters infected with various prion strains [17, 18] and more notably in ex- tracts of brain from human patients affected by the disease [19, 20]. These studies demonstrate that the ox- idative damage of macromolecules leads to a progressive decline in cell and tissue function. Mitochondria consti- tute a major cellular source of ROS generation and are the main targets of ROS-induced oxidative cellular dam- age. Indeed, some reports showed that PrP106-126 in- duces neuronal cell death by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction [21]. However, the pathogenesis and the molecular basis of neuronal cell death induced by PrP106-126 or PrPSc are unclear except for the demon- stration of early increased production of ROS [22, 23] and oxidative damage. Previous studies have shown that the ubiquitously expressed c-Abl tyrosine kinase is a transducer of a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic cellular signals [24, 25]. c-Abl par- ticipates in neuronal development and morphogenesis, and its activation is linked to oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death through Tau hyperphosphorylation or p73 upregulation [26]. c-Abl in non-neuronal systems is a protein that controls cell survival in an arrested state and apoptosis. The apoptotic activity of c-Abl is mediated by p73, a member of the p53 family, and through a p53-dependent pathway. c-Abl phos- phorylates p73 at the tyrosine residue and drives it to the nucleus, where p73 can activate p53-responsive genes and induce apoptosis [27, 28]. Interestingly, the c-Abl/p73 path- way is also activated in the hippocampus of Alzheimers patients and murine models of AD, a well-known neurode- generative disease involving oxidative stress [29]. Studies have shown that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor enhances clearance of PrPSc via specific inhibition of c-Abl in prion-infected cell culture models, without influencing biogenesis, localization, or biochemical features of PrPC [30, 31]. We hypothesized that c-Abl may be involved in oxidative stress-induced neu- ronal apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the influence of c-Abl tyrosine kinase on the regulation of PrP106-126-induced neu- ron apoptosis. Our results showed that c-Abl plays a key role in mitochondrial dysfunction in response to PrP106-126 stim- ulation in neurons and suggest that the blockade of c-Abl tyrosine kinase-mediated apoptosis could be an effective ther- apeutic approach for prion and other neurodegenerative diseases. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Beijing Municipality on the Review of Welfare and Ethics of Laboratory Animals approved by the Beijing Municipality Administration Office of Laboratory Animals (BAOLA). Cell Culture Experiments were conducted on primary cultures of rat hip- pocampus neurons and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells (Neuro2A cells). The choice of Neuro2A cells is justified by their close similarity to primary hippocampus neurons in mechanisms mediating neuronal cell activation [32, 33]. Pri- mary cultures of rat hippocampus neurons isolated from em- bryonic day 18 (E18) rat embryos were grown as described previously [34]. The Neuro2A cell was obtained from Dr. Yuqin Liu (Xiehe Medical University, Cell Culture Center, Beijing, China) and cultured as described previously [35]. Prion Protein Peptide The PrP106-126 peptide (sequence KTNMKHMAGAAAA GAVVGGLG) was synthesized by Sangon Bio-Tech, China. The purity of the prion peptide was >95 % according to the data from the synthesizer. The peptide was dissolved in 0.1 mol/l PBS to a concentration of 1 mmol/l and allowed to aggregate at 37 C for 12 h. Experiments were conducted with a final peptide concentration of 100 mol/l. Thioflavine-T Fluoreometric Assay The fibril formation of PrP106-126 was measured by using a thioflavine-T (ThT) fluorometric assay according to published reports [36, 37].

Cell Viability Assays Cell viability was evaluated using a CCK-8 assay. Briefly, after each treatment, 10 m of WST-8 reagent was added and Neuro2A cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 C and 5 % CO2. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader with a background control as the blank. The cell survival ratio was expressed as the percentage of the control. Immunofluorescence Staining The spinal cord neurons were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (RT) and washed thrice for 5 min with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Goat serum was added and incubated at RT for 1 h and then washed thrice for 5 min with PBS. Rabbit anti-c-Abl (1:200), rabbit anti-active caspase-3 (1:200), and rabbit anti-caspase-9 (1:200) were added, respectively, and incubated at 4 C overnight and washed thrice for 5 min with PBS. Goat anti-rabbit IgG Cy5 (1:200) and FITC-conjugated antibody (1:200) were added and incubated at 37 C for 1 h and washed thrice for 5 min with PBS. DAPI (1:10) was added and incubated at RT for 5 min and washed thrice for 5 min with PBS. The neurons were finally mounted with glycerin buffer and examined under an OLYMPUS microscope immediately. Small Interfering RNATransfection Small interfering siRNA targeting c-Abl (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used for silencing c-Abl expression. Neuronal cells were plated at 1105 cells/well in a 12-well plate for 24 h before transfection with siRNA in accordance with the man- ufacturers instructions. Briefly, on the day of transfection, 75 ng siRNA was diluted in 100 l culture medium without serum. A volume of 5.5 l of the transfection reagent (HiPerfect Transfection Reagent, Qiagen) was added to the diluted siRNA and mixed by vortex. The samples were then incubated for 5 to 10 min at room temperature to allow the formation of transfection complexes before adding the com- plexes into the cell culture. The c-Abl expression was deter- mined by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Determination of Mitochondria and Cytoplasmic Proteins by Western Blotting Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins were extracted from the cell culture using a protein extract kit (Cytoplasmic and Mitochondria Protein ExtractionKit, SangonBio-Tech, China). Equal amounts of proteins (40 g in each lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % gels, and the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific bind- ing sites were blocked by incubating the membrane with 5 % fat-free dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T, 10 mmol/l Tris, 0.15 mol/l Nacl, 0.05 % Tween-20, pH of the solution adjusted to 7.5). Rabbit anti-c-Abl (1:200), anti-cytochrome C (1:500), anti-Bax (1:500), anti-BIM (1:100), anti-MST1 (1:500), anti-p-Y412-c-Abl (1:500), anti-p-Y245-c-Abl (1:500), anti-caspase-9 (1:200), or anti-active caspase-3 (1:200) antibodies were added and incubated at 4 C overnight. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and then incubated with the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000). Immunoreac- tive proteins were visualized after membrane incubation with enhanced chemifluorescence (ECF) reagent for 5 min, on an image system (Versadoc, Bio-Rad). Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (MTP) Assay MTP was evaluated by the cationic fluorescent indicator JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), which aggregates in intact mitochondria (red fluorescence) with normalMTP. JC-1 remains in the monomeric form in the cytoplasm (green fluorescence) of cells with disrupted mitochondrial mem- brane. Neuro2A cells were incubated in DMEM medium containing 10 M JC-1 at 37 C for 15 min, washed with PBS, and then transferred to a clear 12-well plate. JC-1 ag- gregate fluorescent emission was measured at 583 nm with an excitation wavelength of 526 nm, and JC-1 monomer fluores- cence intensity was measured with excitation and emission 1104 Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:11021116 wavelengths at 525 and 530 nm, respectively. Finally, the cells were mounted with the DakoCytomation fluorescent medium and visualized via fluorescence microscopy. Assay of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) ROS was measured using a ROS assay kit (Beyotime, China) as previously described [38]. Briefly, the growth medium of Neuro2A cells was decanted and the cells were washed with PBS before incubation with 27-dichloroflurescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) in fresh DMEM at a final concentration of 10 M for 20 min at 37 C. Then, the cells were washed three times with the culture medium without serum. ROS levels were assessed by measuring fluorescence at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 528 nm. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay The TUNEL assay was used to measure cellular apoptosis using an in situ Apo-BrdU DNA fragmentation assay kit (BioVision, San Francisco, CA, USA) following the manu- facturers instructions. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were preincu- bated with 50 l of a DNA-labeling solution (10 l TdT reaction buffer, 0.75 l TdT enzyme, 8 l Br-dUTP, 32.25 l DdH2O) for 1 h at 37 C and then with 5 l anti- BrdU fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody for 0.5 h at room temperature (20 C). Finally, the cells were mounted with the DakoCytomation fluorescent medium and visualized by fluo- rescence microscopy. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Neuro2A cells were treated and then washed twice in PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in a fixative containing ice-cold 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 C for 15 min, and then centrifuged. Cell pellets were fixed for 4 h. After a complete rinse with sodium cacodylate buffer, the cell pellet was further fixed in 1 % OsO4 in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer on ice for 1 h and dehydrated with acetone. The cell pellet was embedded in EM-bed 812 resin and polymerized at 60 C for 48 h. Ultrathin sec- tions (70 nm) were obtained on a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Vienna, Austria) and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before observation under a JEM-2100 TEM (JEOL, Japan). RNA Isolation, Complementary DNA Synthesis, and Quantitative PCR Total RNAwas extracted from cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and reverse- transcribed into cDNA using a commercial kit (cDNA Syn- thesis Kit; Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, USA) using oligo (dT) 18 primers in accordance with the manufacturers in- structions. Quantitative PCR was performed using a commer- cial mix (SYBR Green Master Mix; Bio-Rad) and a thermal cycler (DNA Engine Opticon 2 system; MJ Research, Wal- tham, MA, USA) with the primers shown in Table 1. The amplification efficiency of these primers had been established by means of calibration curves. The total volume for qPCR was 20 l, comprised of 8 l water, 0.5 l of each primer (10 mol/l), 10 l Master Mix, and 30 ng of cDNA. The PCR amplification was as follows: denaturation at 94 C for 2 min, 40 PCR cycles of 94 C for 20 s, 55 C for 20 s, 72 C for 20 s, followed by 1 cycle at 84 C for 1 s appended for a single fluorescence measurement above the melting temperature of possible primer-dimers. Finally, a melting step was performed consisting of 10 s at 70 C and slow heating at a rate of 0.1 C per second to 95 C with continuous fluorescence measure- ment. Quantification was performed using the comparative CTmethod (2CT). All samples were analyzed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis All assays were performed on three separate occasions. Data are expressed as meansSD. Parametric data were analyzed using Students t test or one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Turkeys test using the SPSS software (version 13.0: SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P<0.05 was considered significant. Results The Activation of c-Abl Tyrosine Kinase by PrP106-126 in Neuronal Cells The non-receptor tyrosine protein kinase c-Abl participates in a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases, and its activa- tion can cause neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in Table 1 Primers used for quantitative PCR Name Sequence (53) -Actin GCTTCTTTGCAGCTCCTTCG CCTTCTGACCCATTCCCACC c-Abl CACTCTCAGCATCACTAAAG GATGTAGTTGCTTGGGACCC MST1 GATGGCTCCTGAAGTTATT CTGGCTTACGGAATGTGGG BIM GGCCAAGCAACCTTCTGATG CTTGCGGTTCTGTCTGTAGGG Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:11021116 1105 mouse disease models in response to amyloid beta fibrils and oxidative stress [3941]. The c-Abl kinase was altered in response to oxidative stress and A fibrils in neuronal cultures [42]. We examined whether c-Abl tyrosine kinase was acti- vated in neurons exposed to PrP106-126. First, we examined the expression and subcellular distribu- tion of c-Abl protein in Neuro2A cells treated with 100 M PrP106-126 for 12 to 30 h by fluorescence microscopy. The expression of c-Abl protein which appears as red fluorescence declined in PrP106-126-treated Neuro2A cells at all time points examined, compared with the negative control (Fig. 1a). The weakest fluorescence intensity of c-Abl protein after the stimulation of PrP106-126 was observed at 18 h. To further confirm the change of c-Abl protein, we tested the PrP106-126-treated Neuro2A cells by immunoblotting. Con- sistent with the fluorescence results, we found that the level of c-Abl protein was significantly decreased after incubation with PrP106-126 at all time points examined (Fig. 1b). The maximum decrease of c-Abl protein expression by PrP106- 126 was observed at 18 h (21 % of the negative control), and the expression slightly recovered at 24 and 30 h (38 and 56 % of the negative control, respectively) (Fig. 1c). To our surprise, the findings in primary cultures of rat hip- pocampus neurons were very encouraging and in agree- ment with the previous results by immunoblotting (Fig. 2a (the first line of the protein bands), b). Full activation of c-Abl kinase activity requires the phos- phorylation of both Y245 and Y412 [4347], and we, there- fore, wondered if the downregulation of the protein was derived from the phosphorylation of the protein. In order to further examine our hypothesis, we tested the phosphorylation forms of c-Abl protein by western blot in primary rat neurons. We selected the two sites that had been used in examining the phosphorylation of c-Abl protein p-Y412 and p-Y245 in our research. In line with our assumption, after the stimulation of PrP106-126, both the p-Y412 phosphorylated and p-Y245 phosphorylated c-Abl protein levels significantly increased (Fig. 2a (second and third lines of the protein bands), c, d). ThT fluorometric assay showed the presence of amyloid aggregates in PrP106-126 preparation with the treatment of Neuro2A cells and primary hippocampus neurons (Fig. 3). Taken together, we determined that the non-receptor c-Abl tyrosine kinase was activated after the stimulation of PrP106- 126 in neurons. PrP106-126 Upregulated the mRNA Expression of c-Abl, MST1, and BIM Previous studies showed that c-Abl tyrosine kinase is a novel upstream activator of MST1 and BIM [4850]. On the other hand, oxidative stress activated mammalian Ste20-like kinase (MST), which subsequently leads to increased MST1 protein stability and activation of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) by disrupting association with the inhibitory adaptor protein 14-3- 3 in neuronal cells. Activated FOXO3 promotes neuronal cell death through the induction of the pro-apoptotic gene BIM [51]. We found that treatment of Neuro2A cells with 100 M PrP106-126 for 24 h induced a massive (>65 %) cell Fig. 1 Distribution and expression change of c-Abl protein in Neuro2A cells exposed to PrP106-126.

Cell death began after a 10-h latency phase and 35 % cell loss was observed after 12 h (data not shown). To investigate the involvement of c-Abl activation in PrP106- 126-induced neuronal cell apoptosis, we first examined the effect of PrP106-126 treatment on the mRNA expression of c- Abl and MST1 in Neuro2A cells and primary neurons. PrP106-126 treatment significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of both c-Abl and MST1 at 648 h in both neuro- nal cell types (Fig. 4a, b, d, e). The maximum upregulation (by two- to threefold relative to the negative control) was observed at 18 h for both c-Abl and MST1. Since the mRNA level of both c-Abl and MST1 was significantly increased at 18 and 24 h, we next examined the mRNA expression of the BIM gene. As expected, the mRNA of BIM in Neuro2A cells significantly increased by 60 and 30 % compared to the negative control at 18 and 24 h, respec- tively (Fig. 4c). The trend of BIM expression in primary rat neurons was similar to that in Neuro2A cells (Fig. 4f). These results indicate that activation of c-Abl may be involved in PrP106-126-induced neurons apoptosis. c-Abl Regulated BIM Promoter Activity in Response to PrP106-126 To elucidate the role of c-Abl in the regulation of MST1 and BIM expression in neurons, we analyzed the effect of siRNA- Fig. 2 PrP106-126 induced the activation of c-Abl in primary cultures of rat hippocampus neurons. Primary neuronal cells were cultured on cov- erslips in a 12-well plate for 12 h and then treated with PBS (negative control) and PrP106-126 (100 mol/l). The cells were harvested, lysed, and dissolved for the western blot (WB) assay. aData showWB analysis of c-Abl (b), p-Y412-c-Abl (c), and p-Y245-c-Abl (d) expression.

The efficiency of siRNA-mediated knockdown was evalu- ated at 24 and 48 h after siRNA transfection by qPCR (Fig. 5a) and western blot analysis (Fig. 5b). Expression of c-Abl was significantly downregulated both at the mRNA and protein levels by 74 and 87 %, respectively, after siRNA transfection. PrP106-126 induced maximum expression ofMST1 and BIM in Neuro2A cells at 18 h (see above). The knockdown of c- Abl significantly reduced the upregulation of MST1 and BIM mRNA induced by PrP106-126 (Fig. 5c, d). The protein level of MST1 and BIM was also downregulated (Fig. 5e, f). These findings suggest an active participation of the tyrosine kinase c-Abl in the regulation of BIM promoter activity. Blockade of c-Abl Expression Abrogated PrP106-126-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction Since the mitochondria are the central organelles for apoptotic cell death signaling [52], we assessed whether the blockade of c-Abl expression abrogates PrP106-126-mediated mitochon- drial dysfunction. The mitochondrial function was assessed using the JC-1MTP assay. PrP106-126-treated Neuro2A cells displayed increased green fluorescence (JC-1 monomer form) and decreased red fluorescence (JC-1 aggregates form), indi- cating low MTP values and thus mitochondrial dysfunction compared with negative control cells (Fig. 6a). The knock- down of c-Abl by siRNA transfection reduced PrP106-126- induced JC-1 monomers and increased JC-1 aggregates, indi- cating normal or improved mitochondrial function, compared with the control cells without transfection with siRNA. We also found that PrP106-126 treatment significantly increased ROS production compared with the PBS-treated control cells using the fluorescent probe DCFH. Neurons pretreated with c-Abl siRNA had significantly lower ROS levels compared with the untransfected cells (Fig. 6b). It is well known that Bax proteins act downstream in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Thus, we tested the effect of c-Abl on PrP106-126-induced Bax translocation and cyto- chrome c release, and the effects were inhibited by c-Abl siRNA treatment (Fig. 6c). The ultrastructure of the mitochondria was observed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to further study whether morphological changes of the mitochondria occurred in response to PrP106-126 treatment (Fig. 7). In normal cells, the mitochondria are dense and in an elongated form with intact cristae (Fig. 7a). Cells infected with PrP106-126 displayed abnormal mitochondrial morphology. The affected mitochondria appeared vesicular, swollen with a vacuolar Fig. 4 PrP106-126 increased the mRNA expression of c-Abl, MST1, and BIM.Measurement by quantitative PCR of c-Abl (a, d), MST1 (b, e), and BIM (c, f) mRNA expression in Neuro2A cells and primary neuronal cells at the indicated time points after exposure to PrP106-126.

Accompanied with the above changes were myelin figures, autophagosomes, and/or autophagolysosomes (Fig. 7d). In comparison, the mitochondria of c-Abl-blocked neurons treat- ed with PrP106-126 showed normal morphology and intact cristae (Fig. 7c). Collectively, these results indicated that the knockdown of c-Abl expression blocked PrP106-126-induced apoptosis by prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction. Blockade of c-Abl Protects Neuronal Cells from PrP106-126-Induced Apoptosis Sequential activation of apoptotic factor caspase-9 followed by caspase-3 is important in apoptotic cell death [5355]. To determine the mechanism of PrP106-126-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells, we studied whether PrP106-126 treatment activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 and whether c-Abl is in- volved in the activation of these caspases. We incubated Neuro2A cells with c-Abl siRNA for 48 h to knockdown endogenous c-Abl expression and then exposed the cells to PrP106-126. PrP106-126 treatment of untransfected neuronal cells led to caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and cell death (Fig. 8). c-Abl knockdown of neu- rons alleviated PrP106-126-induced cell death and significant- ly reduced the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 to their subunits of p33 and p17, respectively (Fig. 8ac). The densi- tometric quantification analysis for the activation of the caspase-9 and caspase-3 cascade showed that c-Abl knock- down of neurons significantly reduced the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 compared with the PrP106-126- treated only group, and they reached 65 and 66 %, respective- ly (Fig. 8d). Consistent with the above findings, TUNEL staining showed that the c-Abl knockdown of neurons signif- icantly decreased cell apoptosis (Fig. 8e). Compared with the untransfected cells treated with PrP106-126 only, the viability of c-Abl siRNA-transfected cells and then exposed to PrP106- 126 significantly increased (Fig. 8f). The cell death was con- firmed by TEM examination (Fig. 9). Except for the altered mitochondria as described above, typical apoptotic hallmarks, such as chromatin rearrangements and condensation or chro- matin released into the cytoplasm, nuclear condensation or fragmentation, the presence of an intact cytoplasmic mem- brane and vacuolization, the formation of apoptotic bodies, Fig. 5 Knockdown of c-Abl expression inhibited the activation of MST1 and BIM in response to PrP106-126 peptide stimulation.

TEM showed that the organelles of neurons transfected with c-Abl siRNA remain largely intact, although the cells displayed deformed mitochondria with abnormally swollen cristae (Fig. 9b). Together, these results indicate that c-Abl plays an important role in apoptotic death of neuronal cells. Discussion In this study, we found that c-Abl tyrosine kinase was an important component in the neuronal death process in re- sponse to PrP106-126. PrP106-126 stimulated c-Abl expres- sion and other apoptosis-associated genes (such as MST1 and BIM) and factors. Suppression of c-Abl expression by small interfering RNA inhibited the prion-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway including MST1 and BIM expression, Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis. Blocking c-Abl also suppressed ROS production in neuronal cells in response to PrP106-126. c-Abl Activation and Oxidative Stress While the activity of c-Abl is crucial for neuronal develop- ment, c-Abl is relatively quiescent in healthy adult neurons and there are few known functions of c-Abl in fully differen- tiated neurons. Recent studies showed that activation of c-Abl in adult brain occurs in neurodegenerative diseases. It has also been reported that oxidative stress activates c-Abl in neuronal cells, which subsequently activates p53 and induces cell death [5658]. PrP106-126 directly induced an early increase in ROS in neuronal cells in our study and in other neuronal models reported by other authors [59, 60]. We showed that blocking of c-Abl expression attenuated ROS production in neuron cells treated with the prion peptide fragment, PrP106- 126, suggesting that c-Abl modulates ROS production. Thus, Fig. 6 Knockdown of c-Abl prevented mitochondrial dysfunction in- duced by PrP106-126. a Neuro2A cells were transfected with c-Abl siRNA and then exposed to PrP106-126 for 18 h. Mitochondrial trans- membrane potential (MTP) was measured using JC-1 as the fluorescent marker. The JC-1-aggregate form, indicating normal MTP, appears red and the monomeric form, indicating low MTP (i.e., disrupted mitochondrial membrane), is green by confocal microscopy.

It appears that c-Abl activation and oxidative stress or ROS production are interrelated. ROS production and increased c-Abl expression/activation in neurons may create a vicious cycle in the cell death pathway. c-Abl, MST1, and BIM Yuan and colleagues showed that c-Abl tyrosine kinase is a novel upstream activator of MST1 [49, 61]. The c-Abl- dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of MST1 increased the interaction between MST1 and FOXO3, thereby leading to cell death in both primary culture neurons and rat hippocam- pal neurons. The authors proposed that the c-Abl-MST1 sig- naling cascade plays an important role in cellular responses to oxidative stress. Consistent with Yuan and colleagues find- ings, we demonstrated that c-Abl inhibition by siRNA signif- icantly attenuated the prion fragment-inducedMST1 and BIM expression in neuronal cells. The siRNA-mediated disruption of c-Abl did not completely abrogate BIM production, as residual BIMwas detected. This may be due to the incomplete silencing of c-Abl by siRNA or the existence of alternative pathways for BIM activation. Differences in the stimulation of c-Abl, MST1, and BIM by PrP106-126 were noted between Neuro2A cells and rat hippocampal neurons, with greater effects in primary rat neurons than in the Neuro2A cell line. The differences may be due to the adaptation of Neuro2A cells grown in culture to high oxygen concentration, which may have rendered cells in culture less sensitive to neurotoxic prion protein fragment than freshly dissected hippocampal neurons. Nonetheless, molecular responses of neuronal cells to PrP106- 126 were very similar between Neuro2A cells and primary hippocampus neurons, and the c-Abl-MST1 signaling path- way may play an important role in cellular response to prion. c-Abl and Mitochondrial Damage The typical neurodegenerative pathway in prion disease is through mitochondrial damage [62, 63]. c-Abl plays a critical role at mitochondria in apoptotic induction [64, 65]. We investigated the effect of c-Abl on PrP106-126-mediated mi- tochondrial abnormalities. We found that blocking c-Abl of Neuro2A cells inhibited prion-mediated mitochondrial dys- function and cell apoptosis. PrP106-126 induced Bax Fig. 7 Morphological changes of mitochondria in Neuro2A cells ex- posed to PrP106-126. Neuro2A cells were transfected with c-Abl siRNA and then exposed to PrP106-126 for 18 h.

Although the neuronal toxicity of PrP106-126 has pre- viously been reported to require the presence of microglia which respond to this peptide by increasing their oxygen radical production [66], we report here a direct neuronal response to PrP106-126 with a rapid production of ROS. The fact that we are using a stringent culture medium could explain whywewere able to observe a direct effect on neurons which may be prevented in usual conditions by elements contained in serum [67]. TEM confirmed mitochondrial dam- age in Neuro2A cells exposed to PrP106-126, and the mito- chondrial structural changes were significantly reduced by c- Abl blockade. Our data are consistent with earlier findings where PrP106-126-induced apoptosis is dependent on mito- chondrial dysfunction [6870]. These observations strongly suggest that blocking c-Abl expression inhibits prion- mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. c-Abl and Autophagy While our study demonstrated that the c-Abl tyrosine kinase may mediate PrP106-126-induced neuronal cell apoptosis, interestingly, we also observed the presence of autolysosomes and autophagosomes in dying Neuro2A cells exposed to PrP106-126 peptide. The knocking down of the c-Abl protein by siRNA prevented the formation of autolysosomes and autophagosomes. It is possible that c-Abl regulates PrP106- 126-induced neuron death by mediating the autophagy pro- cess, which has been reported in other studies [71, 72]. Au- tophagy is a two-edged sword that could result in cell survival or cell death. It can accelerate the progression of disease in many cases while playing a protective role under certain circumstances [73]. Jeong et al. reported that PrP106-126 peptide stimulation could lead to oxidative stress in SH- SY5Y cells, and treatment with melatonin [62] or resveratrol [74] protected the cells against prion-mediated neurotoxicity via activating the autophagy pathway. On the contrary, our results indicate suppression of autophagy by silencing c-Abl, which protected neuronal cells from prion fragment-induced cell death. However, the prevention of autophagy by c-Abl siRNA could also be secondary to the inhibition of the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis rather than a direct inhibi- tion of autophagy. The differences could be attributed to the difference of cell types, exposure time, and concentration. Possibly, these differences may indicate the different roles that autophagy plays in prion disease progression at different stages of cellular lesions, extracellular environment, and Fig. 9 Morphological changes of Neuro2A cells exposed to PrP106-126. Neuro2A cells were transfected with c-Abl siRNA and then exposed to PrP106-126 for 18 h. The cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy. aCells without any treatment showed normal mitochondria (light blue arrows) and nucleus ultrastructure (white arrow). b si-RNA- transfected and PrP106-126-treated cells showed mitochondrial swelling; c nuclear fragmentation and chromatin released into the cytoplasm (blue arrow); and d chromatin condensation with slight degeneration of the cytoplasm and nuclear condensation (red arrow), formation of apoptotic bodies (yellow arrow), a large number of vacuoles in the cytoplasm (green arrows), expansion and disorganization of the smooth endoplasmic retic- ulum (violet arrows) Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:11021116 1113 therapeutic interventions [7578]. The role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases has not yet been completely un- derstood [79, 80]. Further investigation is warranted for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of autophagy regu- lation in prion disease. The appropriateness of the PrP106-126 model is still questioned because it is not certain whether it reproduces the events occurring in prion diseases. However, this model is relevant for the detection of early events which precede neu- ronal death. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that activation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase by PrP106-126 leads to cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons, and c- Abl mediates downstream events of the mitochondrial apo- ptosis pathway in neuronal cells exposed to the prion frag- ment. Although more studies are needed to confirm and explore the role of c-Abl in prion disease, our findings raise the hope of targeting the c-Abl protein as a therapeutic ap- proach in the early treatment of prion-related neurodegenera- tive diseases.
