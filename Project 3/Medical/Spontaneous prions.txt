Eisenberg, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, and approved June 29, 2010 (received for review March 28, 2010) Prionsare transmissible agents that cause lethalneurodegeneration in humans and othermammals. Prions bind avidly tometal surfaces such as steel wires and, when surface-bound, can initiate infection of brain or cultured cells with remarkable efficiency. While in- vestigating the properties of metal-bound prions by using the scra- pie cell assay tomeasure infectivity,weobserved, at low frequency, positive assay results in control groups in which metal wires had been coatedwithuninfectedmousebrain homogenate. This pheno- menonprovedtobe reproducible in rigorousandexhaustive control experiments designed to exclude prion contamination. The infec- tivity generated in cell culture could be readily transferred to mice andhadstrain characteristicsdistinct fromthemouse-adaptedprion strains used in the laboratory. The apparent spontaneous genera- tion of prions from normal brain tissue could result if the metal surface, possibly with bound cofactors, catalyzed de novo forma- tion of prions from normal cellular prion protein. Alternatively, if prionswerenaturally present in thebrain at levels notdetectableby conventional methods, metal surfaces might concentrate them to the extent that they become quantifiable by the scrapie cell assay. cell culture | scrapie | metal | CreutzfeldtJakob disease Prions, the transmissible agents that cause fatal neurodegen-erative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie in animals, oc- cur in the form of various strains and are composed principally or entirely of aggregates of misfolded cellular prion protein (PrPC), generally referred to as PrPSc. Replication comes about by auto- catalytic conversion of PrPC to the pathogenic isoform (1). In vitro and in vivo studies using model systems have suggested host-encoded cofactors are required to facilitate the propagation of prions (25). A variety of polyanionic compounds, lipids, pro- teoglycans from brain homogenate or purified protein have been shown to stimulate the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in vitro (610). Steel wire exposed to scrapie prioninfected brain or brain ho- mogenate acquires an extraordinary infectious potential (11, 12). Although the amount of protein bound was undetectable by con- ventional methods, thewires were as effective in eliciting disease as injection of approximately 106 LD50 units in the form of brain ho- mogenate. We have isolated an N2a neuroblastoma-derived cell line, N2aPK1 (i.e., PK1) (13), that is highly susceptible to in- fection by a wide spectrum of murine strains, including RML and 22L, but not ME7 and 301C (13, 14). When PK1 cells were grown onRMLprioncoatedwires, adherent cells becamePrPSc-positive, in contrast to neighboring cells, which remained negative, implying that adherence to the prion-coated surface is a prerequisite for infectivity transfer (15). We exploited these observations to detect prions in RML prioninfected brain homogenates diluted as much as 1010, by adsorbing infectivity to steel wire surfaces and sub- jecting PK1 cells grown on these surfaces to the scrapie cell assay (SCA) (16). In the course of experiments investigating the prop- erties of metal-bound prions, by using the SCA to measure in- fectivity, we observed at very low frequency several instances of positive assay results in control groups in which metal wires had been exposed only to uninfected normal mouse brain homogenate. This phenomenonwas investigated in rigorous and exhaustive con- trol experiments designed to exclude prion contamination. Results Apparent Generation of Spontaneous Prions on Metal Surfaces in Cell Culture. In a typical experiment, wire segments were incubated with dilute homogenate of uninfected or RML prioninfected brain, washed, and covered with susceptible PK1 cells. After 3 d, cells adhering to the wires were collected and the proportion of infected cells was determined by the SCA in endpoint dilution format (SCEPA) (13): 24 replicate 1,000-cell samples were seeded into 96-well plates, grown to confluence, and propagated for 18 d with periodic splitting. Finally, the proportion of PrPSc-positive cells in each well was determined. Because infectivity spreads ef- ficiently from infected to noninfected cells during passaging (13, 17, 18), wells initially containing one or more infected cells end up with a high proportion of infected cells (i.e., positive wells). Remarkably, in nine of 16 experiments control wells scored posi- tive, at an overall level of approximately 2% (40 of 2,268 wells). We repeated the study on a larger scale in an off-site laboratory without previous prion exposure. All equipment and consumables were purchased new and delivered directly to the designated site. PK1 cells were cultured for 3 d in antibiotic supplemented Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with10% FCS with (i) no additions, (ii) 104 normal mouse brain homogenate, (iii) noncoated steel wires, or (iv) wires coated with 104 normal mouse brain homogenate. The cells were harvested, and for each condition 960 one-thou- sand-cell replicates were placed in the wells of ten 96-well plates and subjected to SCEPA as described earlier (Fig. 1A) (13). Only group iv yielded positive wells, i.e., wells in which spots per well exceeded the average of control samples plus 10 SDs (n=66). The histogram in Fig. 1B shows the distribution of spots per well: for samples i through iii, none of 2,880 wells had 81 or more spots. In contrast, in the case of cells exposed to homogenate-coated wires (i.e., group iv), nine wells had 81 to 160 spots and three had more than 160 spots, among 960 wells. The 12 group iv samples that had more than 81 spots per well, as well as 12 random samples from each control set, were expanded into eight replicate wells of a 96- well plate, grown to confluence, and assayed for PrPSc-positive cells. Four of the 12 initially positive samples still scored positive, whereas wells from all other conditions were negative. Titration and Mouse Bioassay of Spontaneous Prion Infectivity.

In all cases, titers were approx- imately 104 LD50 units/mL 100 concentrated medium. Prion in- fectivity was confirmed by inoculating groups of 10 tga20mice (19) intracerebrally (i.c.) with 100 concentrated conditioned medium from each of the four samples of groups (iiv). Clinical scrapie at high attack rates andwithmean incubation times of 82 ddeveloped in mice inoculated with material from the four positive samples of group iv (Table 1), which equates to approximately 104.5 LD50/mL inoculum based on standard curves of incubation period of RML prions in tga20mice. No transmissions were seen for samples from groups i through iii. Histopathological and immunochemical ex- amination of brains of mice inoculated with concentrates from the negative wells, culled after 200 d, showed no evidence of disease. In contrast, the mice that developed clinical scrapie showed striking neuropathological features (Fig. 2), and the presence of PrPSc was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). Strain Typing of Spontaneous Prions. Prion strains can be distin- guished by distinct histopathological patterns in inoculated ani- mals (20) or by distinctive fragment sizes and ratios of protease- resistant PrP glycoforms (21). Western blot analyses (Fig. 3) of protease-resistant PrP from brains infected with RML prions, with conditioned medium from chronically infected PK1 cells (iPK1), or from the four isolates of spontaneous infectivity, did not reveal any differences. However, it should be noted that some biologically distinct mouse-adapted scrapie strains such as RML and 22L show indistinguishable PrPSc deposition pat- terns (22). Interestingly, the histopathologic findings of brains (n = 25) inoculated with spontaneously generated prions was distinct from that of brains inoculated with authentic RML prions: the former showed intense abnormal PrP deposition predominantly in the thalamus, midbrain, and brainstem and weaker, patchy de- position in the frontal cerebral cortex (Fig. 2) whereas, notably, the hippocampus was free of abnormal PrP; in contrast, RML- inoculated tga20 brains (n=13) showed abnormal PrP deposition over the entire cortex, basal ganglia, and very prominently in thal- amus and hippocampus. Indeed, the histopathology associated with spontaneous prions was unlike any seen previously in our laboratory. The distinctive histopathological pattern elicited by the spontaneous prions excludes contamination with RML or Fig. 1. Generation of spontaneous infectivity. (A) Scheme of experiment: PK1 cells were exposed to (i) tissue culture medium only; (ii) 104 normal mouse brain homogenate; (iii) untreated steel wires; or (iv) steel wires coated with 104 normal mouse brain homogenate. Cells were propagated for six splits and assayed by the SCA (16). Twelve of 960 wells from group iv scored positive whereas all the other 2,880 wells scored negative. Cells from the positive wells and 12 wells chosen at random for the other three conditions were expanded and tested for PrPSc-positive cells. Four of the original 12 positive wells remained positive and were expanded into 15-cm dishes, along with four wells chosen at random from each of the other conditions. Conditioned medium (c.m.) from the 16 samples was concentrated 100 and injected i.c. into groups of 10 tga20 mice each. (B) Histogram of the SCA spot count. Spots represent immuno- reactive particles counted, i.e., PrPSc-positive cells and background particles. Blue: Control groups (iiii) all show fewer than 81 spots per well (n = 2,880). Purple: Histogram of cells exposed to homogenate-coated wires (group iv) is skewed to the right, with a second peak at 81 to 160 spots per well and values extending to 160, 188, 190, and 250 spots per well. Edgeworth et al. PNAS | August 10, 2010 | vol. 107 | no. 32 | 14403 M IC RO BI O LO G Y othermouse-adapted scrapie strains used by us as a cause for these mouse transmissions. Given the prion strain selectivity of PK1 cells (14), the sponta- neously generated prions must be of a strain type permissive for propagation in these cells. We considered therefore whether in fact iPK1 cells, although originally infected with mouse-passaged RML prions, were in fact propagating a distinct strain that might have arisen by adaptation to this cell line, with strain selection or mutation to a preferred conformer (23, 24). We therefore also compared transmissions of both spontaneously derived prions and mouse RML with those from infectivity derived from the super- natant of iPK1 cells. We inoculated concentrated, conditioned medium from iPK1 into tga20mice and harvested the brains at the preterminal stage. Surprisingly, the histopathology was distinct from that of RML prion-infected brain, but very similar to that of mice inoculated with the spontaneous prions. Discussion Human prion diseases may be acquired, inherited (with patho- genic germline mutation in PRNP) or sporadic, probably as a consequence of rare, stochastic de novo formation of prions (25).

A few animals were found dead in these groups at a similar period to affected mice and may also have been affected, but no biological samples were recoverable and so were disregarded. *Affected mice were confirmed positive by histological and/or Western blot analyses. Fig. 2. Histopathologic findings in brains of tga20 mice inoculated with spontaneous or brain-derived RML prions. Prions derived from cell cul- tures exposed to metal wire coated with normal mouse brain homogenate produce a distinctive pattern of PrP deposition in the brain of inoculated tga20 mice. (A) Spontaneously generated prions cause deposition of ab- normal PrP in thalamus, brainstem, and, to a lesser extent, superficial layers of the frontal cortex, whereas the hippocampus is strikingly spared. (C) Mouse-passaged RML prions cause a more intense deposition in the super- ficial layers of the cortex and of the thalamus, and most prominently in- cludes the hippocampus, a feature not seen in any mice inoculated with spontaneous cell-passaged prions.

Western blot analysis of protease-resistant PrP from infected mouse brains. tga20 mice were inoculated with RML-infected brain homogenate, concentrated conditioned medium from iPK1, or from the four groups of cells that became PrPSc-positive after contact with homogenate-coated wires (Groups 1-4). Brains from preterminal animals were homogenized, PK- digested, and subjected to Western blot analysis (31). 14404 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1004036107 Edgeworth et al. www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1004036107 Deleault et al. (8) reported de novo generation of prions by the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) procedure, using PrPC purified from normal brain as substrate. However, the resulting strain could not be distinguished fromRML.Generation of novel prion strains by PMCA was also reported by Barria et al. (26) and byWang et al. in a novel PMCA system based on purified recombinant PrP, a synthetic anionic lipid and liver RNA (10). Prion strains, even those subjected to biological cloning, may be heterogeneous at a molecular level and consist of an ensemble or quasispecies which may be selected by, and adapt in, different hosts (23, 24). According to such a model, this novel strain may have been selected from an ensemble of spontaneous prions as the preferred molecular species for stable propagation in PK1 cells, essentially adapting to PK1 cells in a similar way in which RML prions appear to have done. PrPSc could occur at very low levels in healthy brains, almost never reaching levels that lead to disease (27). If so, uninfected brain homogenates might contain undetected PrPSc seeds that are concentrated on steel wires (16) and infect PK1 cells in our experi- ments. However, if normal brain is devoid of prions, our results mean that infectivity is generated de novo, perhaps by a mecha- nism in which seed formation is catalyzed by the steel surface (Fig. S1). It is also possible that brain lipids and/or RNA, known to be able to act as cofactors in some experimental systems (8, 10), could have bound to wires and played a role in triggering de novo prion formation in PK1 cells. This raises the question as to whether spontaneous prions are indeed generated de novo or whether brains from uninfected animals contain a low level of prions that are concentrated by adsorption to the wire surface and thereby rendered detectable by the SCA. Differentiating between these possibilities is a chal- lenging one but could be achieved by kinetic experiments: pro- pagation of preexistent seed should be proportional to brain homogenate concentration; de novo seed formation would be a higher-order function of concentration (28, 29). Methods Culturing and Storage of N2aPK1 Cells. N2aPK1 cells (13), susceptible to several mouse prion strains, including RML and 22L, were cultured in Opti-MEM + 10% v/v fetal calf serum (OFCS; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin/ streptavidin. Preparation and End Point Titration of RML Prions. RML prioninfected brain homogenate (designated I6200) was prepared and titrated as previously described (30). Pretreatment of Wires.Wires, in batches of 100, were incubated with 20mL of OFCS only (group iii, untreated wires) or 104 uninfected CD-1 mouse brain homogenate diluted in OFCS (group iv, coated wires) for 3 h at room temperature, washed in PBS solution five times for 15 min and air-dried. Twenty wires were placed into individual wells of a six-well tissue culture plate (Corning). Exposure of Wires to Na2PK1 Cells and Scrapie Cell Assay in Endpoint Format. N2aPK1 cells were seeded at 3  105 cells per well of six-well cluster plates (Corning) containing 5 mL OFCS together with (i) no further additions; (ii) 104 uninfected CD-1 brain homogenate; (iii) 20 noncoated monofilament Steelex wires; or (iv) 20 monofilament Steelex wires coated with 104 un- infected CD-1 mouse brain homogenate. Cells were grown to confluence for 3 d at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cells were harvested from wells or, in the case of wire-exposed cells, wires with adherent cells were transferred to a fresh well containing 2 mL OFCS and adherent cells were rinsed off; cells were counted and seeded at 1,000 cells per well into wells of 96-well plates (Corning). The samples were assayed by the SCEPA as described previously (16). Preparation of Concentrated Conditioned Medium from PrPSc-Positive and - Negative PK1 Cells. Cells from a single well of a 96-well plate were ex- panded into eight replicate wells of a 96-well plate and grown to confluence, and 25,000 cells from each well were seeded into wells of ELISPOT plates. The proportion of PrPSc-positive cells in each well was assayed as described previously for the SCA (13). Wells were deemed infected or positive when the spot number was greater than the average value given by uninfected control cells plus 10 SDs. Cells from positive wells were expanded further into 15-cm tissue culture dishes. When cells reached 60% confluence, the medium was replaced with 20 mL OFCS. Conditioned medium was col- lected at 24-h intervals for two successive days, pooled, and centrifuged at 100,000  g for 1 h at 4 C. The pellet was resuspended in one hundredth the original volume of PBS solution to yield the 100 conditioned medium. Testing for Transmissibility of Spontaneous Infectivity to PK1 Cells. Condi- tioned medium, concentrated 100, was assayed at 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions by the SCA as previously described (13). The spot numbers generated in the SCA were converted to LD50 units/mL: a titration curve of LD50 units versus spot number in the SCA was fitted to the phenomenological function S = Ln  M / (Ln + K), where S is the spot number recorded in the assay, L is the number of LD50 units, n is an arbitrary power function, K is a saturation constant, and M is the asymptotic maximum spot number. The calibration data are fitted to this function by using Grafit software (Erithacus Software) to derive values for n, M, and K. From these values, spot numbers were converted to LD50 units using the relationship L = [S  K / (M  S)]0.5. Testing for Transmissibility of Spontaneous Infectivity in Mouse Bioassay. Animals were cared for per institutional and home office regulations. Ani- mals were observed daily for clinical signs and culled on diagnosis of prion disease. For each of the test conditions, groups of 10 tga20 mice were in- oculated i.c. with 30 L of 100 conditioned medium. One hundred tga20 mice were also inoculated i.c. with 30 L of 1% CD-1 homogenate prepared from the same pool of uninfected CD-1 mouse brain homogenate used to coat the steel wires in the off-site experiment. Brains were excised and ex- amined by histopathology and Western blotting. Histopathology. Mouse brains were fixed in 10% buffered formol-saline, im- mersed in 98% formic acid for 1 h followed by 24 h in 10% formalin, and em- bedded inparaffinwax. Sectionswere cutatanominal thicknessof4m.Gliosis was detected with anti-GFAP rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:1,000; Dako). To detect abnormal PrP deposition, mounted sections were treated with 98% formic acid for 5 min, placed on an automated staining machine, heated to 95 C in 2.1 mM Tris-HCl, 1.3 mM EDTA, 1.1 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.8, for 30 min, digested for 16 min with a low concentration of protease (iView/Ventana Medical Systems), incubated in Superblock for 10min, then exposed to ICSM35 (1 g/mL; D-Gen), followed by biotinylated antimouse IgG secondary antibody (SA-HRP; iView), and color was developed with 3,3- diaminobenzidine tetra- hydrochloride (iView). Hematoxylinwas usedas the counterstain. Photographs were taken on an ImageView digital camera (www.soft-imaging.de) and composed with Adobe Photoshop. Sections of brains were examined by the same person, who was blinded to the identity of the animal and genotype. Western Blot Analysis. Aliquots of 10% (wt/vol) brain homogenates, with or without earlier proteinase K digestion (50 or 100 g/mL final protease con- centration, 1 h, 37 C) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electropho- resis and immunoblotting as described (31). Blotswere blocked in PBS solution containing 0.05% vol/vol Tween-20 (PBST) and 5% nonfat milk powder, ex- posed to anti-PrPmonoclonal antibody ICSM35 (0.2 g/mLfinal concentration in PBS solutionwithTween-20) for 90min, followedbyantimouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min, all at room temper- ature. After incubation with the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star (Tro- pix), signals were visualized on Biomax MR film (Kodak), all as described (31). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
