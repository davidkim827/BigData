The Story of Data MULTIVARIATE MODELS MULTIVARIATE SCENARIO NOTHING IN LIFE IS EVER SO SIMPLE MULTIVARIATE VS MULTIPLE REGRESSION So far, we have been working with y = f(x) + e where f(x) is of the form b 1 x 1 +b 0 but most real world problems there would be more than one independent variable x 1 ,x 2 , x 3  That is more than one attribute determine the dependent variable Such problems are Multiple Regression problem and when there are more than one dependent variables, it is called Multivariate. Please note we still are considering only one dependent variable. What to do If there are more than one dependent variables -- at this time, the option is to run lm on each dependent variable In what follows we continue with one dependent variable and many independent variables. CAN I PREDICT PETROL CONSUMPTION ? My Variables -- income -- Income -- miles -- Number of miles of roads available -- driver -- Number of drives living in the region -- tax -- Tax per gallon of petrol -- petrol -- Petrol consumed Given more miles, more eligible drivers with more income  miles driven should be higher Tax per gallon should discourage consumption of petrol Understanding the problem and the data  So called wide format  One observation per row  Each row fully defines  Each column is an attribute  One dependent variable  Other columns are independent columns  In this dataset, petrol consumed is the independent variable  The challenge is how much of that consumption is determined by tax, income,miles and proportion of drivers  Which of these variables influence gas consumption  Which is more dominant, sensitivity analysis EDA MULTIPLE REGRESSION IN R lmds<-lm(petrol~.,data=gas) petrol = 377.3 -34.79 tax-0.06659 income-0.002426 miles+1336 drivers Results are not consistent with our intuition Models have to be consistent with reality and to an extent our intuition Tax and drivers consistent Miles and income not so MULTIPLE REGRESSION IN R -- run pairwise regression and add them back -- remove some counter-intuitive variables -- remove collinear variables -- scale the variables PETROL CONSUMPTION VS GAS TAX PER GALLON If we raise tax, we expect people to buy less Model is consistent with reality and our intuition. Results are reliable p-value less than 0.05 indicates we can reject the NULL  there is a relationship  the observed data is not due to chance and the variable explains 20% Of the variability in the dependent variable. REALITY > INTUITION > MODEL First, exercise caution when counter-intuitive P-value says cannot reject NULL NULL for lm is there is no relationship. So the estimated coefficient for income Is not reliable. May not have any influence. And R-Square tells us this variable has No explanatory potentialit is explaining 5%. MORE DRIVERS MORE CONSUMPTION MILES DO NOT HAVE BEARING ON CONSUMPTION Scaling There are some nuances Income varies at a different level And at a different rate Unit of change in one variable Does not equal a unit of change in another one. Y=b 1 x 1 +b 2 x 2 +b 3 x 3 will not make sense  So we have to scale them so that they are all in the same unit  Let us take a look at the mean and standard deviation by each column Issues Particular to MultiVariate datasets Senstivity analysis will yield wild results if we dont correct for this in a multivariate setting Particularly if the covariates are correlated  that is, a change in one variable results in the change of other co-variates names(gaspx) scaled.gaspx<-scale(gaspx) # scale the data,it has additional attributes scaled.gaspx.d<-scaled.gaspx[1:48,] # so we extract rows of scaled observations names(scaled.gaspx.d)<-names(gaspx) # we copy the names of the columns lm.scaled.gaspx<-lm(petrol~.,data=as.data.frame(scaled.gaspx[1:48,])) Normalization  Scaling Multivariate datasets What is the correlation like? Let us create a scaled dataframe (name, (x-mean)/std var) Do these correlations make sense? LM: IS THIS A PARADOX? GLM AIC AND DEVIANCE? GOODNESS OF FIT AIC/DEVIANCE Both GLM the Deviance is decreasingthis is a measure of deviation and So lower deviation implies model yields closer prediction However AIC for the scaled model is lower  indicating glm yields a better fit when presented with scaled data in the case of MV data The F-Statistic is another statistic and it is the ratio of two variances (SSR/SSE), the variance explained by the parameters in the model (sum of squares of regression, SSR) and the residual or unexplained variance (sum of squares of error, SSE).
