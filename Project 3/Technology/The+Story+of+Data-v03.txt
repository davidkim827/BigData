UNSTRUCTURED 01 https://breakthroughanalysis.com/2008/08/01/unstructured-data-and-the-80-percent-rule/ [[https://www.bing.com/search?q=proportion+of+unstructured+to+structured+data]] [[https://sherpasoftware.com/blog/structured-and-unstructured-data-what-is-it/]] Unstructured data is raw and unorganized and organizations store it all. Ideally, all of this information would be converted into structured data however, this would be costly and time consuming. Also, not all types of unstructured data can easily be converted into a structured model. For example, an email holds information such as the time sent, subject, and sender (all uniform fields), but the content of the message is not so easily broken down and categorized. This can introduce some compatibility issues with the structure of a relational database system. Social Media Posts Looking at the list, you may be wondering what these files have in common. The files listed above can be stored and managed without the format of the file being understood by the system.
