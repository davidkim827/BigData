Abstract This article investigates the microeconomics of employment dynamics, using a Chinese manufacturing firm-level data set over the period 19982007. It does so in the light of a scheme of circular and cumula- tive causation, whereby firms heterogeneous productivity gains, sales dynamics and innovation activ- ities ultimately shape the patterns of employment dynamics. Using firms productivity growth as a proxy for process innovation, our results show that the latter correlates negatively with firm-level em- ployment growth. Conversely, relative productivity levels, as such a general proxy for the broad techno- logical advantages/disadvantages of each firm, do show positive effect on employment growth in the long-run through replicator-type dynamics. Moreover, firm-level demand dynamics play a significant role in driving employment growth, which more than compensate the labor-saving effect due to techno- logical progress. Finally, and somewhat puzzlingly, the direct effects of product innovation and patent- ing activities on employment growth appear to be negligible. JEL classification: D22, J01, O33 1. Introduction For those who believe that the economy is characteristically in a General Equilibrium and Says law applies, the im- pact of technical change upon employment is no big deal: structural unemployment can only be considered a tempor- ary problem, in that the labor-saving effect of technological progress can be automatically adjusted by the market (see Freeman et al., 1982; Dosi, 1984; Vivarelli, 1995; Vivarelli, 2014 and Calvino and Virgillito, 2017, for discus- sions and critiques of the implied compensation theory). However, the historical evidence militates against any self-equilibrating market mechanism, with long spells of unemployment both in now-developed and developing countries. Indeed, the broad duality of technological change implies that the utilization of labor force is endogenously generated by demand creation due to product innovation or expanding existing markets, on the one hand, and continuous labor displacement due to process innovation, on the other hand. In that, the homeostasis between the two forces cannot be guaranteed, because of the major disconti- nuities in technological innovation, the long-term changes in the balance process vs. product innovation, the VC The Author(s) 2018.

If this is the case, however, it becomes crucial to understand the determinants of employment dynamics also at sectoral and firm levels. This is what we shall do in the following, examining the impact of technological catching- up, sales dynamics, and innovation activities on employment growth in China, making use of a large representative sample of Chinese manufacturing firms covering the period of Chinese economic boom before the global financial crisis. Our approach to the relationship between technological change and employment dynamics is a partial disequi- librium one, grounded on heterogenous patterns of firm-level learning and catching-up, fueled by Kaldorian proc- esses of circular causationthat is of dynamic increasing returns, linking productivity, sales growth, and further efficiency gains (Freeman, Clark, and Soete, 1982; Dosi, 1984; Dosi, Pavitt, and Soete, 1990; Freeman and Soete, 1994; Vivarelli and Pianta, 2000; Lee, 2013; Dosi, Grazzi, et al., 2015; Bogliacino et al., 2017). In turn, sales dynam- ics, at least in the case of China, have been driven to a good extent by export growth. We interpret the latter in a technology-gap perspective, whereby the absolute advantages/disadvantages of sectors and firms evolve according to (i) the dynamics of the technology they master compared to their foreign competitors, (ii) their cost competitive- ness (i.e. relative unit labor cost, RULC), and (iii) the elasticity of their sales to world income dynamics. Exports, as such an important indicator for countrys international competitiveness, but also play an important role in stimulat- ing macroeconomic activities and employment growth through the foreign-trade multiplier (Thirlwall, 1979, 1980; MacCombie and Thirlwall, 1994).1 Of course the overall dynamic is affected by the sectoral ones which in turn sums up the dynamics of a large number of highly heterogenous firms. Hence, in the following we start by studying the sectoral-level employment dynamics as the outcome of sectoral average productivity growth and sales growth. In turn, exports are an important component of sales, and they are jointly affected by world income growth, variations on sectoral unit labor cost (relative to the rest of the world), and (relative) innovativeness. Behind sectoral dynamics, however, rest a multiplicity of heterogenous firm-level patterns. Thus, next, we investi- gate the microeconomics of employment as the outcome of firm-specific technological learning, capital accumula- tion, and sales variation within narrowly defined sectors. The question is the extent to which firm-level employment dynamics is affected by the labor displacement associated with productivity growth as compared to the labor creation induced by product innovation and sales growth. Furthermore, we address the two-sided impact of sales growth on employment growth: firm-level demand expansion creates, other things being equal, job opportunities, but it also plays a significant role in driving up productivity due to Kaldorian increasing returns and capability accumulation (Cimoli, Dosi, and Stiglitz, 2009). In brief, we find that Chinese employment dynamics reveals a KeynesianKaldorian adjustment story, in presence of a fast and very successful technological catching-up. At the sectoral level, labor demand is largely driven by sector- al sales growth, while the growth of productivity is markedly labor displacing, even if it helps cost competitiveness (proxied by RULC). In turn, sectoral sales growth is primarily determined (via exports) by world income growth and to a less extent by the variations of sectoral unit labor cost. Interestingly, during the period under investigation, prox- ies for product innovativeness do not seem to contribute directly to sales/or export growth, except few sectors (prob- ably a sign that sectors as a whole have not reached the international technological frontier). At the firm level, the labor-displacing effects of productivity growth are often overcompensated by the dramatic growth in sales. Together, productivity levels do show positive effect on employment growth through the replicator-type dynamics: more pro- ductive firms grow more in terms of employees. Finally, at micro level, product innovation does appear to have posi- tive effect on labor demand. Conversely, firms patenting activities (in the United States) do not correlate with employment growth (note however that the surge in Chinese patenting abroad is a quite recent phenomenon). The article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the state of the art on the evidence both at the sec- toral and firm level. Section 3 presents our simple interpretative models. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the broad patterns of growth, export, and employment dynamics in China up to the Crisis. Section 6 presents our sectoral- and firm-level empirical results. Section 7 concludes. 1 Kaldor (1970) and Thirlwall (1979) suggest that if balance of payments equilibrium must be maintained, a countrys long- run growth rate will be determined by the ratio of its rate of growth of exports to its income elasticity of demand for imports (Thirlwalls law). As known, China overshot the constraint and ran throughout a significant surplus. 80 G. Dosi and X.

Employment dynamics at sectoral and firm level: a brief review of the evidence The empirical literature on the relationship between technical change and employment at both sectoral and firm level is critically reviewed in Calvino and Virgillito (2017) to which we refer for all details and the full list of references. Here let us just mention the thrust of the findings. In general the literatureboth theoretical and empiricalon sectoral-level employment dynamics is based on par- tial disequilibrium framework interpreting it as a result of structural change involving both embodied and disembod- ied technological change and changing patterns of consumption (for a seminal theoretical model, see Pasinetti, 1981). On the empirical side one often finds an overall positive relationship between structural change, proxied by relative sectoral value-added growth and growth in employment; a negative relationship between productivity growth and employment growth; and a positive effect of product innovations on sectoral employment growth.2 A second stream of literature adopts the Haltiwanger-type job flow measure (Davis and Haltiwanger, 1990; Davis et al., 1998) and finds that sectors with more process innovation have a higher job destruction rate and a lower net employment growth rate, vice versa for sectors with more product innovation.3 Notice that most of the foregoing studies refer to developed countries. An interesting question is whether the dif- ferential impact of product vs. process innovation applies also to the sectors on a catching-up country, like China. We shall address that in the following. Finally, a third stream of studies which is not generally associated with the analyses of sectoral dynamics is based on a technology-gap trade framework and emphasizes in the first instance the intercountry differences in innovativeness (within the same sector) as the basis of international trade flows and implicitly sectoral dynamics. Rather than interin- dustry variations in the technological endowments of a specific country, it is the variation in innovativeness within each sector across countries which is deemed to be crucial. Indeed, in Dosi et al. (1990) and Dosi, Moschella et al. (2015), one suggests that countries sectoral market shares are mainly shaped by technological factors, while cost advantages/disadvantages do not seem to play any significant role. However, the technology-gap framework has never been extended to the studies on employment dynamics. This is another task that we shall undertake in the following. Considering firm-level employment dynamics, let us refer again Calvino and Virgillito (2017). Only some remarks are in order. Notice, first, that a much wider literature addresses the issue, but also that the methodologies are quite different mostly employing to different degrees some equilibrium assumptions concerning micro decisions on the de- mand for labor together with in our view equally questionable assumptions on the existence of some well-behaved production function.4 This notwithstanding, some relatively robust patterns have emerged. A large number of micro-econometric studies detect the direct impact of innovation on employment, without identifying the compensation mechanism (the indirect effect) through lowering cost competitiveness and creating/ enlarging markets.5 A number of empirical works have tried to disentangle the effect of process and product innovation on firm-level em- ployment. Most studies have found a positive impact of product innovation on employment via new demand, especially when the new products cannot perfectly substitute the old products within the same firm, while the impact of process in- novation seems more ambiguous. The direct impact of process innovation is to increase productivity, implying a labor- displacement effect.6 However, there can be an indirect effect of process innovation on employment that the increasing productivity may be associated with sales growth and employment growth driven by strengthening cost competitiveness. There have been few empirical studies on the employment impact of innovation or technological catching-up in the context of developing countries.7 2 See among others Pianta et al. (1996), Vivarelli et al.

(2016). 5 See among others Van Reenen (1997), Greenhalgh et al. (2001), Piva and Vivarelli (2005), Coad and Rao (2011), Bogliacino et al. (2012), Ciriaci et al. (2015), and Van Roy et al.

What does one see when one abandons such a perspec- tive and considers the evidence of microeconomic employment dynamics in a (micro-founded) disequilibrium framework? This is one of the questions that we shall address in the following. 3. Interpretative models 3.1 Sectoral-level employment dynamics: the model Let us consider sectoral employment change starting from the simple identity: Njt  Yjt Pjt; (1) where Njt is sectoral employment (sector j at time t), Yjt is sectoral output, 8 and Pjt is sectoral (weighted-) average labor productivity. The dynamic version of (1) is: DNjt Njt  DYjt Yjt  DPjt Pjt; (2) where DNjt is Njt Nj;t1. Here, obviously, sectoral employment dynamics is positively associated with sectoral-level output/demand growth which, in turn, we shall argue on the interpretative side, is shaped by the sectors absolute competitiveness in the international market, and negatively associated with sectoral labor productivity growth. Notice that, labor productivity, as measured in actual data, does not capture only physical productivity but also reflects variations in value added generated, for example, by high-quality products which are sold at higher prices. More generally, productivity is related to the way in which the process of production is carried on (on average) in the sector, and thus also reflects the efficiency of organizational routines and the dynamic capabilities of the firms in that sector and country. Next, let us derive the determinants of the dynamics of sectoral absolute competitiveness as a function of the dy- namics of technological absolute advantage, cost advantages, and world income growth. In a first approximation suppose that the variation of demand of sector j of a country, say China, depends on the change of the commodities relative prices in sector j of the country to the world price of the same sector (Pjt) and the variation of world income (Ywt). DYjt Yjt  gp DPjt Pjt  gy DYwt Ywt; (3) where gp is the price elasticity of demand (plausibly gp < 0) (i.e., an increase in price leads to some proportional de- crease of demand), gY is the income elasticity of demand (gY > 0) (i.e., the degree to which increases in world income lead to proportional increases of demand). The relative price of commodities of sector j is a function of sectoral RULC. The variation of the relative price in sector j is: DPjt Pjt  l1  DRULCjt RULCjt ; (4) where l1 is a constant capturing the dynamics of the markup, RULC is the relative (Chinese) ULC of sector j to the world ULC of the same sector.9 The RULC can be expressed as ULCChina;jtEt ULCWorld;jt where Et is the trade-weighted bilateral exchange rate index, and the dynamic version of relative ULC can be expressed as DULCChina;jt ULCChina;jt  DEtEt  DULCWorld;jt ULCWorld;jt . 8 Here, we assume for simplicity, sectoral output equals demand. 9 Notice that the unit labor cost of sector j in country i (ULCjt) is defined as the ratio between sectoral average wage per employee (Wjt) and sectoral labor productivity (Pjt). 82 G. Dosi and X. Yu D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /icc/article-abstract/28/1/79/5063532 by N ew York U niversity user on 06 M ay 2019 In comparison with the world, the dynamics of sectoral cost advantages/disadvantages captures the joint effect of wages and labor productivity. We can plug the price variation Equation (4) into the demand growth Equation (3). Thus: DYjt Yjt  l2  gp DRULCjt RULCjt  gy DYwt Ywt ; (5) sales growth of sector j is a function of the growth of RULC of China and world income growth. Indeed, Equation (5) just states that sectoral sales growth is jointly determined by some cost effect and some world income ef- fect. Sectoral sales growth is the outcome of an absolute measure of competitiveness (i.e. independent of the competi- tiveness of other sectors within China). The cost effect is measured by (the variation of) RULC, as a proxy of cost advantages, which is jointly determined by (the dynamics in) wage gap (measured in international currency) and the dynamics in labor productivity gaps, which, it is important to note, reflect underlying technological catching-up dynamics. Finally, we augment the estimates with a patent-based variable, a measure of sectoral technological absolute advantages, as compared to sectors/countries on the frontier, specially in product innovations. Thus: DYjt Yjt  a gp DRULCjt RULCjt  gy DYwt Ywt  bDPATSjt PATSjt ; (6) where PATSjt proxies the sectoral frontier innovativeness. In this work, the proxy is Chinese patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). After estimating Equation (6) and evaluating its robustness, we shall use it to estimate the overall sectoral employ- ment effect of export dynamics. 3.2 Micro-foundation of technology-gap theory and employment dynamics: a general disequilibrium firm-level model In line with theoretical interpretation of the sectoral-level employment growth, our firm-level employment dynamics is jointly shaped by the overall market growth, the firm-specific labor productivity, and the dynamics of firm-specific competitiveness (influencing firms sales growth) within a narrowly defined (four-digit) sector. Let us start from the simple relation: DNijt Nijt  g DPijt Pijt ; DYijt Yijt   ; (7) where DNijt=Nijt denotes the employment growth of firm i in sector j and year t; DPijt=Pijt is firms labor productivity growth; and DYijt=Yijt stands for the growth of sales of the firm. 10 Of course, the growth of sales of a firm depends on the growth of the market DYj=Yj and the dynamics of the share in it of i, DSij=Sij. The latter, we suggest in an evolutionary perspective, depend on firm-specific competitiveness. The notion is grounded on the persistent heterogeneity among firms and the systematic processes of competitive se- lection among them. Firms persistently differ over all dimensions one is able to detect. Idiosyncratic capabilities and, dynamically, idiosyncratic patterns of learning by individual firms are the general rule. In turn, such persistently het- erogeneous firms are nested in competitive environments which shape their individual economic performances and collectively the evolution of the forms of industrial organization. Differences in product characteristics and in the processes of production are central features of the competitive process by which some firms grow, some decline, and some go out of business. Evolutionary approaches have often modeled the competitive process by different instantiations of some replica- tor dynamics. The bottom line is a relation between some corporate featuresthat is, technological, organizational, or behavioral traitswhich the particular interactive environment favors, on the one hand, and the dynamic 10 Of course, for each firm the relation (7) is an identity, but overall it captures the average effect of productivity and sales growth upon employment growth and that stops being an identity.

(1988); Dosi et al. (1995), and the discussion in Dosi and Nelson (2010)). In its linear specification: DSijt Sijt  f Eijt  EjtSij;t1; (8) where DSijt=Sijt is the rate of change in the share of firm i in the total production of the sector; Eijt represents firms competitiveness (capturing the firms technological and cost advantages); and Ejt is the average of the variable(s) over all firms within the sectors. Below we shall proxy competitiveness with the productivity levels of firm i (Pij) relative to the sectoral average, and, in some specifications, with the shares of new products in the total output of the firm. In the opposite direction, in the spirit of the circular and cumulative causation scheme, increasing returns in the accumulation of capabilities imply a positive association with demand dynamics, that is the dynamic version of KaldorVerdoorn law: DPijt Pijt  h DYijt Yijt   : (9) Hence, the micro-founded technology-gap theory of employment growth, based on the interaction between growth in productivity and demand variation, develops along three different sequences. First, increases in labor prod- uctivity are likely to lead to labor shedding, other things being equal. However, second, relative labor productivities affect the competitiveness of each firm and through that the dynamics of market shares and thus its demand. Finally, third, increases in productivity are stimulated by growth in production through increasing returns, learning, and the accumulation of capabilities. 4. Data and descriptive statistics 4.1 Database description: firm-level data This work draws upon firm-level data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Enterprise collected by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The data set includes all industrial firms with sales above 5 million RMB cover- ing period 19982007 and has already been employed in other empirical investigations, including Dong and Xu (2009), Yu et al. (2015), and Yu et al. (2017).11 The surveys cover approximately 5579 million workers, accounting for about 7.5%10.5% of the total employment. Each firm is assigned to a sector according to the four-digit Chinese industry Classification (CIC) system that closely matches the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) employed by the US Bureau of Census.12 Out of the comprehensive set of all firms, we focus on manufacturing firms only (CIC 1342). Table A1 (in Appendix A) shows the summary statistics of manufacturing firms. The total number of employees in the manufacturing sector has increased from 50 in 1998 to 68 million in 2007. (In fact, it decreased by 5.7 million during period 1998 and 2001, then increased thereafter.)13 4.2 Variables used in firm-level analysis We measure the firm-level employment growth rate as the log difference of employment levels of 2 consecutive years: Dnijt  nijt  nij;t1, where nijt is ln(Nijt). Productivity (pijt) is the (log) ratio of value added (at constant prices) over the number of employees. Productivity growth (Dpijt) is the log difference of productivity levels of 2 consecutive 11 Industry is defined to include mining, manufacturing, and public utilities, according to NBS of China. Five million RMB is approximately $US 600,000. 12 In 2003, the classification system was revised. Some sectors were further disaggregated, while others were merged together. To make the industry code comparable over time, we adopted the harmonized classification proposed in Brandt et al. (2012). 13 We have applied a few cleaning procedures to the data set to eliminate visible recording errors. We dropped firms with missing, zero or negative output, value-added, sales, original value of fixed assets, employment (<8). And we keep firms existing for at least 2 consecutive years. 84 G.

Productivity as measured could also repre- sent product innovations, especially if we consider revenue productivity, and in some sense, we partly capture revenue productivity. Industry deflators do not cancel completely the price effects in productivity. We define firms sales growth (Dgijt) as the log difference of (constant price) sales in 2 consecutive years. We use 2-year moving average of investment intensity as proxy for investment: Iijt  INVijtINVij;t1VAijtVAij;t1 , where INVijt is real invest- ment, and VAijt denotes real value added. 15 We use the percentage share of new products in total output as our proxy for product innovation (NEWPROD).16 Note that, only less than 5% firms display positive shares of new products. Firm age is computed using information on firms foundation year. Our proxies for firm size are (log-) number of employees and (log-) sales. Table 1 provides basic descriptive statistics of the main variables used in the empirical analysis. Finally, we use as yet another proxy for innovativeness the patents granted in the United States identified through a procedure discusses in Appendix B.17 4.3 Sectoral data For sectoral analysis, our firm-level data set has been aggregated at four-digit sectoral level, to obtain total (real) value-added, total employment, total (real) sales, and total (real) exports for each four-digit sector. Sectoral employ- ment growth, sales growth, and labor productivity growth are calculated as above. Table A2 (in Appendix A) pro- vides basic descriptive statistics of the main variables used in the empirical analysis. The growth rate of RULC of sector j at time t can be derived based on: (i) the growth rate of Chinese unit labor cost of sector j at time t; (ii) the growth of trade-weighted bilateral exchange rate index (i.e. trade-weighted world currency per Chinese yuan);18 Table 1.

Growth rates are calculated as log differences of real value, at 1998 constant price. 14 Sales, value-added, and output are all deflated using the same deflator constructed by Brandt et al. (2012). 15 Notice that, we compute real investment at time t as the difference of firms real capital stock between time t and t1. The time series of real capital stock are computed following Brandt et al. (2012) that apply a standard perpetual inven- tory method, with a 9% rate of depreciation. 16 According to NBS of China, new products are defined as product adopting new technology and/or new design, or products that have been significantly improved in performances and functions over existing ones by improving their structure, materials, and/or process technics. Hence, these new products are new to the enterprises but not new to the market. Because output of new product is not available for years 2001 and 2004, we fill in the gaps using the aver- ages between the values of previous year and the next year for each firm. 17 A dummy variable distinguishes firms holding patent for at least 1 year in the USPTO during 1998-2007. 18 To calculate it, we use two variables (i) G7 trade weights, calculated by authors based on NBSC statistical yearbook; (ii) bilateral exchange rates between Chinese yuan and G7 currencies, directly available from IMF.

For details, see Appendix B).21 5. The general picture There are five fundamental characteristics of Chinas economic miracle which place the discussion that follow in the proper context. First, Chinese economic growth has occurred and is occurring in dual economic system, characterized by the per- sistent coexistence of a relatively modern sector and a traditional rural one. The unlimited supplies of labor from the traditional sector served as a source of cheap labor for almost three decades of rapid capital accumulation and industrialization in China, without dramatic increase in wages (see Lewis, 1954; Lutz, 1958; Cai and Wang, 2010). This is also reflected in the limited role of wages in the growth of Chinese aggregate demand during the early phase of transition, and in a rather stable import propensity. Indeed, Chinese manufacturing RULC shows a decreas- ing trend until 2004 and kept stable/or mildly increased afterward (see Figure 1), suggesting an increasing cost advan- tage, too, until 2004. Second, the dramatic productivity growth and catching-up has been well documented. For example, Yu et al. (2015) estimate a 10% labor productivity growth and Brandt et al. (2012), a 7.7% TFP growth, intimately coupled with process of technological and organizational learning and knowledge accumulation (see Fu an Gong, 2011; Yu et al., 2017). Third, export grew at a spectacular rate even if the export share into the total Chinese manufacturing output has increased only mildly from 18.3% in 1998 to 22% in 2006 (see Table A1). The foreign-trade multiplier played an im- portant role during the Chinese catching-up process, with export fueling effective demand and leading to overall in- crease in output and employment (see Lin and Li, 2003; Fu and Balasubramanyam, 2005).

Source: Chinese firm-level data set (Chinese unit labor cost); OECD.stat (G7 unit labor cost); China Statistical Yearbook (China-G7 trade weights); IMF (ex- change rates between China and G7 countries). 19 We proxy it using the G7 countries manufacturing ULC growth rates: source OECD.stat. 20 Source: IMF World Economic Outlook Database, gross domestic product, constant prices, percentage change. 21 The United States as a major technology market indeed appears to be a good mirror of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) or world technology market: more in Dosi et al. (1990). 86 G. Dosi and X. Yu D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /icc/article-abstract/28/1/79/5063532 by N ew York U niversity user on 06 M ay 2019 Fourth, the employment growth has been much lower than the overall income growth of China. This is hold both for the economy as a whole and for the industrial sector alone, as shown in Figure 2.22 The elasticity of employment to output, measured as ratio between the rate of growth of employment and the rate of growth of production (cf. Figure 3), shows a steady decreasing trend from 0.15 in 1998 to 0.04 in 2010, with a high volatility in the industrial sector. Such an elasticity was even negative between 1998 and 2003, due to the mas- sive layoff of employees in the state-owned enterprises coupled with the ownership transformation process.23 It surged to around 0.5 during 20042007, dropped again significantly to 0.2 in 2008, the year of the global financial crisis. Both in the overall economy and in the industrial sector, (almost) jobless growth appears to have precociously emerged as a dominant characteristic. Fifth, on the frontier innovative activities are a quite recent phenomenon in China. Table 2 shows the patenting activities in the USPTO. The number of Chinese patents granted has increased from 151 to 4527, accounting for 0.17% in 1998 and 2.46% in 2007 of the non-US assigneess patents (i.e. the year refers to the filing year of the granted patents). Indeed, patenting has exploded since then. 6. Empirical results 6.1 Sectoral-level empirical estimates First, we estimate Equation (2) for each two-digit sector, that is sectoral-level employment dynamics as the joint out- come of productivity growth and sales growth. Results are shown in Table 3. Productivity growth displays very sig- nificant negative association with employment growth at the sectoral level, while sectoral sales growth contributes significantly to employment growth.24 Figure 2. Growth rates of gross domestic product (GDP), industrial value added, total employment, and industrial employment. Note: The employment growth rate time series are discontinuous in 1990, as the employment statistics before 1990 are from a different data collection method.

(2015). 24 In the next few paragraphs, we discuss some inter-industry differences. However, admittedly, we do not consider pos- sible inter-sectoral interdependences in demands and productivities via input/output flows. Evidence from Chinas manufacturing 87 D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /icc/article-abstract/28/1/79/5063532 by N ew York U niversity user on 06 M ay 2019 Adopting the same model, we estimate the association between export growth and employment dynamics. Results are shown in Table 4. The strong positive association of export growth on employment growth appears in the majority of sectors, and in particular, in the manufacturing of furnitures, chemical and metal products, communi- cation equipment and computers, and measuring instruments. The significant labor-displacing effect of productivity growth is particularly revealed in textile, wood products, furnitures, paper, and plastics. Second, we estimate Equation (5), that is sectoral sales growth as the joint outcome of the variation of Chinese RULC and world income growth. The estimates are shown in Table 5.25 The effect of income elasticities dominates Figure 3. The elasticity of employment growth to GDP growth and industrial value-added growth.

Source: PATSTAT (version 2014a). Year refers to patent application year. 25 Here, we adopt regression through the origin (RTO): it implies that the dependent variable is assumed to be 0 when independent variables are 0s. In our case, it means that we assume that when the growth rates of RULC and world in- come are nil, the growth of Chinese sectoral sales/export is equally nil. In fact, the assumption stands for a time zero 88 G. Dosi and X.

We also compared the results between OLS regression (with constant) and RTO. We find that (i) the stand- ard errors of the estimates of RULC are very similar in two methods; (ii) the standard errors of the estimates of world income growth are much smaller in RTO than under OLS. 92 G.

The degrees of income elasticity vary across sectors that the most income elastic (around 4 to 5) sectors include the manufacturing of communication equipment and computers, electric machinery, measuring instruments, and transport equipment. We also estimated the effects of the variations of RULC and world income on export growth. Table 6 shows the results. Again, income elasticity dominates price elasticity in determining Chinese sectoral export growth.

The estimates are shown in Table 7. Together, Table 8 shows the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates for the export dynamics equation. The variation of innovativeness in Chinese manufacturing sectors seems neither contributes to sales growth nor exports growth, but, to repeat, our data refer to a stage of catching-up which by now is mostly over. 6.2 Firm-level evidence 6.2.1 The econometric strategies Let us turn to firm-level data to analyze the drivers of manufacturing employment through a three-step estimation in line with the theoretical framework of Section 3.2. In the first step, firm-level employment dynamics is jointly determined by productivity growth and sales growth. In the second step, we estimate the replicator-type dynamics linking firms relative competitiveness, the dynamics of the overall market, and firms sales growth. In the third step, we integrate replicator-type dynamics into the first step, directly linking firms relative competitiveness, sectoral sales, and productivity dynamics with employment growth (adding also product innovation and investment). Finally, we estimate the dynamic version of Kaldor Verdoorn law. We resort to an autoregressive distributed lag model that enables us to estimate both the short-run and the long-run effects. We estimate the models for each four-digit sector to ideally identify the level of competition, where replica- tor dynamics operates. At least as important, this regression framework also allows to control both for unobserved hetero- geneity and for endogeneity of all our main regressors through a system GMM estimation (Blundell and Bond, 1998).26 6.2.2 Step 1: Employment dynamics In the first step let us simply account for firm-level employment dynamics (Dni,t) as the joint outcome of productivity growth (Dpi,t) and sales growth (Dgi,t). Employment growth rates vary path-dependently with contemporaneous and past productivity and sales dynamics which reads: Table 6. Continued CIC Sector DRULCjt DWorldIncomet # Obs.

To decide how many lags in the dependent variable to be included into the model, we test the autoregressive struc- ture for employment growth for each four-digit sector. Lags of employment growth of an order higher than two are not significant.28 Hence, we choose K  2 and L  2 after some experiments. We use system GMM to estimate Equation (10) for each four-digit sector.29 Figure 4 shows the distributions of system GMM estimates and the corresponding long-run effects over four-digit sectors. Table 9 shows the median of the distributions of coefficient estimates. As a robustness check, we estimate the same model including year dummies. The results are very similar.30 Contemporaneous and lagged productivity growth display a remarkable labor-displacing effect. Conversely, contemporaneous and lagged sales growth shows significant contributions to employment growth. 6.2.3 Step 2: Replicator dynamics Firms sales can be obviously written as the product of the overall market size Mt and firms market share Si,t.

Distributions of the estimated coefficients and the long-run effects of labor productivity growth and sales growth, across 284 four-digit sectors. The shaded-violins denote the long- run effects. Only four-digit sectors with a number of firms greater than 160. 27 Here we do not control for year dummies, because we focus on the absolute employment growth, productivity growth, and sales growth. But we also test the model including year dummies as a robustness check. The results are very similar. 28 The empirical evidences, in the literature, of the autocorrelation structure of growth rates are mixed: Coad and Holzl (2009) shows negative autocorrelation to the order 2 in terms of employment growth, which is very similar to the finding here. 29 The algorithm for choosing instruments is as follows. First, we treat lagged employment growth, productivity growth, and sales growth as endogenous variables. Their instruments are set from lag 2 to lag 5. We check the P values of AR(2) test and Hansen test after running the system GMM. Second, if either of the two tests are rejected (AR(2) P< 0.1 or Hansen P< 0.45), we adopt further lags as instruments: lag 3 lag 6 for lag employment growth, lag 2 lag 5 for other variables. Then, we check again the P values of AR(3) and Hansen tests. Third, if either of these two tests are rejected at the second step, we instrument all independent variables using lag3 lag6. 30 The same applies in all estimations in this section.

The growth rate of sales of firm i at time t is clearly the sum of the growth rates of its mar- ket share and the growth rate of the overall market size. Here, we measure market size at four-digit sectoral level. In turn the dynamics of a firms market share (Dsi,t) can be interpreted using a replicator-type process as driven by the firms relative competitiveness. Therefore: Dgi;t  XK k1 gkDgi;tk  XL l0 al ~Xi;tl  cDmt  qCONTROLi;t1  i;t; (12) where Dgi,t absolute sales growth of firm i at time t, ~Xi;t is relative competitiveness which shall be defined below, and Dmt is the growth of market size. We control for firms (lagged) size and age. 31 To decide how many lags of dependent variable to be included into the model, we test the autoregressive structure for sales growth for each four-digit sector. Lags on sales growth of an order higher than two are not significant.32 We use two measures to proxy firms relative competitiveness: relative productivity level (i.e. a broader proxy for firms technological and organizational advantages) and relative productivity growth rate (i.e. process innovation). First, let us estimate Equation (12) using relative productivity level as a proxy for relative competitiveness.33 Here, we choose K  2 and L  1 after some experiments. We use system GMM for each four-digit sector. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the estimates. Table 10 shows the median of the distribution of coefficient estimates for the baseline model. The contemporaneous productivity level displays significant positive effect on sales growth; however, the lagged one shows some negative effect (indeed as in Bottazzi et al., 2010 and Dosi, Moschella et al., 2015). The long-run effect of relative productivity level on sales growth is positive and significant. The growth rate of the overall market reveals a mild positive effect on firms sales growth. Second, we use relative productivity growth as a proxy for relative competitiveness. Here, we choose K  2 and L  2 after some experiments, and, again, system GMM to estimate Equation (12) for each four-digit sector. Figure 6 shows the distribution of estimates across 284 four-digit sectors, and Table 11 shows the median of the distributions. The positive effect of relative productivity growth on sales growthin tune with previous studiesis very significant both in the short run and in the long run. The effect of overall market size growth on firm-level sales growth seems significant. 6.2.4 Step 3: Integrate replicator dynamics into employment dynamics model Finally, we plug the model of Step 2 into Step 1 and add other variables (product innovation and investment inten- sity) to estimate directly the effect of firms relative competitiveness, product innovation, and investment intensity on employment growth: Dni;t  XK k1 gkDni;tk  XL l0 al ~Xi;tl  XL l0 nlNEWPRODi;tl  XL l0 hlIi;tl cDmt  fDPt1  qCONTROLi;t1  i;t ; (13) Table 9.

However, in the robustness check, the estimates of the models with year dummies are very similar to our baseline model. 32 Notice that, a comparison of the estimation methods for the autoregressive structure of sales growth is available upon request. 33 In line with Bottazzi et al.

We also include sectoral productivity growth DPt1 and sectoral sales growth Dmt to control for sector-wide dynam- ics in process technology and market size. First, let us consider relative productivity levels as proxy for competitiveness (see Figure 7 and Table 12). Firms relative productivity levels display significant contemporaneous negative effect on employment growth. However, the lagged and long-run effects are significantly positive. Product innovation does not show significant effect on em- ployment growth (but recall the caveats above). Investment intensity seems display a significant positive effect on Figure 5.

Sectoral sales growth displays a very mild positive effect on employment growth, while sectoral productivity growth does not show any effect at all. According to the matching results between our firm-level data set and firms patenting activities in the USPTO, 99% of Chinese patents granted in the USPTO are from the manufacturing of communication equipment computers, etc. (CIC 40) during the period 19982007. We further investigate the effect of patenting activities on firms employ- ment growth for each four-digit sector within the broad CIC 40 sector. (There are 16 four-digit sectors in CIC 40.) We create a time invariant dummy variable distinguishing patenting firms from the others, which equals to 1 if a firm has been granted a patent for at least 1 year. We re-estimate Equation (13) including also the patenting dummies. The patenting one displays significant positive effect on firms employment growth only in two four-digit sectors, which are the manufacturing of communication exchange equipment (CIC 4012) and semiconductor discrete devices (CIC 4052).34 Figure 8.

Here, let us consider the reverse relation and estimate the VerdoornKaldor coefficients, that is the effect of sales growth on productivity growth due to increasing returns: Dpi;t  XK k1 gkDpi;tk  XL l0 blDgi;tl  qCONTROLi;t1  i;t; (14) where control variables involve (lagged) firm size (in terms of employment) and age.35 Here, we take K3 and L3. Three lags of productivity growth are included in the model to obtain consistent estimates, while the con- trolled lagged dependent variables display significant negative effects. Sales growth contributes significantly to prod- uctivity growth both in the short and long run (the distribution of coefficient estimates is shown in Figure 9, and the median values are shown in Table 14). To summarize, the result shows very significant increasing returns just miti- gated by some regression-to-the-mean. 7. Conclusions This article contributes to the analysis of employment dynamics both at the sectoral level and at the firm level for Chinese manufacturing during the period of a striking economic boom. First, employment dynamics at the sectoral level is the joint outcome of the dynamics of labor productivity growth, which we take as a broad measure of technological progress on the one hand, and absolute competitiveness Figure 9.

But we also test the model including year dummies as a robustness check. The results are very similar. 102 G. Dosi and X. Yu D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /icc/article-abstract/28/1/79/5063532 by N ew York U niversity user on 06 M ay 2019 in the international markets, proxied by exports growth, on the other. The results reveal both a powerful labor dis- placement effect of productivity growth and a significant positive contribution of sales and export growth to employ- ment. Together, Chinese sectoral absolute competitiveness is primarily associated with specialization profile characterized by high elasticities to world income growth. In turn such specialization patterns have been shaped by long-term industrial policies (Dahlman, 2009) and are rooted in profound processes of catching-up, imitation, creative adaptation, and organizational innovation (more in Yu et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2017). Second, we considered employment dynamics at the firm level as jointly affected by (relative) productivity level/ growth, product innovation, investment intensities, as well as sectoral sales and productivity dynamics. We found that relative productivity levels (i.e. a higher relative competitiveness of the firms) contribute to employment growth in the long run, while process innovation (proxied by productivity growth) displays significant labor displacement ef- fect.36 Firms investment positively contributes to employment growth. Moreover, firms sales growth plays a two- sided role: while it contributes directly to employment growth, it also drives productivity growth (through increasing returns), thus moderating its labor-creating effect. Third, the insignificant role of innovativeness (proxied by product innovation and patenting activities) suggests that in the period covered by our data, China had not yet reached the technological frontier in most sectors. It is a condition, we conjecture, which has been rapidly changing thereafter.

(iii) We match NBS firm-level database with PATSTAT through the NBS ID and BvD ID. Finally, as shown in Table B3, we get the annual number of patents filed by NBS Chinese firms in the USPTO. We successfully matched 2496 patents with NBS firms (matching rate 88%), among which 2464 patents (99%) are filed by firms in the tele- communication equipment and computers manufacturing (CIC 40).37 Therefore, we only include patent dummy as an additional explanatory variable in the firm-level employment growth model for each four-digit sectors in telecom- munication manufacturing (CIC 40). To estimate the effect of innovativeness at sectoral level, we merge our four-digit aggregated Chinese manufactur- ing data set with the patent data set (Source: PATSTAT version 2014a, USPTO patents only) based on the proce- dures: (i) convert four-digit CIC into four-digit ISIC (Rev3) codes; (ii) match the four-digit patent IPC code with the four-digit ISIC (Rev3) code using the Lybbert and Zolas (2014) method (we use the probability weight) and count the number of Chinese, non-US, and world patents in each four-digit ISIC sector, respectively; (iii) merge the above two data sets by the unique ISIC code.
