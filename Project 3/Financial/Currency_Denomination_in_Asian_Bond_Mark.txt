Introduction The monetary authorities of East Asian countries have recognized the underlying problems caused by a double overdependence on the banking sector in their financial systems and on the US dollar in their currency systems since East Asian economies experienced the Asian Currency Crisis in 1997. We have a problem of how efficiently we should match the savings with the investments within East Asia through regional financial markets although there are both an abundance of savings in East Asia and profitable investment opportunities in East Asian emerging market countries. One of its solutions should be to establish and activate regional bond markets in East Asia. On one hand, it is a problem that especially borrowers in East Asia have been facing foreign exchange risks because they have had debts denominated in terms of a foreign currency in borrowing money from foreign countries. They would face foreign exchange risks if bonds were denominated in the regional bond markets in contrast with local bond markets. The monetary authorities of East Asian countries are actually promoting the Asian Bond Market Initiative,1 that is, a regional financial cooperation to establish Asian bond markets in East Asia. Recent discussions of the Asian Bond Market Initiative have focused on the choice of denomination currency and the credit guarantee and rating agency. Ito (2003) proposed an Asian bond which is designed to be a fund of the local currency denominated bonds issued by governments of East Asian countries. However , there is another choice which is denominated in terms of the US dollar. Actually, as an initiative of the EMEAP, the Asian Bond Fund (ABF) was launched in its first version (ABF1) in June 2003 as a basket of US dollar denominated bonds issued by Asian sovereign and quasi-sovereign issuers in EMEAP economies (excluding Australia, Japan and New Zealand).2 The EMEAP has worked to extend the ABF concept to bonds denominated in local currencies and has announced the launch of the second stage of ABF (ABF2) in December 2004. In previous researches, Ogawa and Shimizu (2002, 2004) compared Asian bonds denominated in terms of the G3 currency basket (a currency basket of the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen) with single currency (the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and seven East Asian currencies) denominated bonds. In this paper, we investigate the risk properties of Asian Bonds denominated in terms of anonther currency basket, the Asian Monetary Unit (AMU) which is formed as a currency basket of ASEAN+4 (Japan, China, Korea, and Hong Kong). As Kawai, Ogawa and Ito (2004) noted, an AMU composed of a currency basket of ASEAN+ 3 (Japan, China, and Korea) currencies would be expected to be equivalent to the G3 currency basket if each of the East 1 The Asian Bond Market Initiative established six working groups, which include new securitized debt instruments, credit guarantee mechanisms, foreign exchange transactions and settlement issues, issuance of bonds denominated in local currency, local and regional rating agencies, and technical assistance coordination. One of the working groups focuses on currency denomination on Asian bond markets. Also, it is written that the possible issuance of Asian currency-basket bonds could be explored under the auspices of the roadmap in the Joint Ministerial Statement of the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers Meeting on May 4, 2005 at Instanbul. 2 EMEAP(Executives' Meeting of East-Asia and Pacific Central Banksis a cooperative organization of central banks and monetary authorities in the East Asia and Pacific region. 1 Asian countries uses the G3 currency basket as a reference or target in conducting their exchange rate policies. The G3 currency basket denominated Asian bonds and AMU denominated Asian bonds would therefore be equivalent, even though this is not the case under the current circumstances. On one hand, Ogawa and Shimizu(2005) prposed an AMU and AMU Deviation Indicators for coordinated exchange rate policies among the monetary authorities of East Asian countries. Shimizu and Ogawa (2005) investigated the risk properties of AMU denominated Asian bonds by comparing them with those of local currency denominated bonds issued in East Asian countries. We suppose the AMU as an Asian currency unit which is formed as a currency basket of East Asian currencies. We simulate a currency basket composed of the ASEAN5 countries, Japan, China, Korea, and Hong Kong. Our results indicate that the AMU denominated bonds can lower the risks for both US and Japanese investors, because the portfolio effects of the AMU reduce foreign exchange risk. However, these results depend on the currency system in the East Asian countries. In this paper, we explain some empirical results related with denomination currency on Asian bonds that we have already conducted in Ogawa and Shimizu (2002, 2004) and Shimizu and Ogawa (2005). We focused on foreign exchange risks for both bond issuers and foreign investors as well as liquidity of bond markets. This paper is organized as follows: the next section points out necessity of developing Asian bond markets for preventing financial crises in the future. The third section explains our empirical results as for foreign exchange risks for bond issuers. The fourth section explains our empirical results as for foreign exchange risks for foreign investors. Portfolio effects of AMU denominated bond on reducing foreign exchange risks are pointed out in the fifth section. We focus on liquidity in bond markets in the sixth section. We summarize and conclude this paper in the last section. 2. Contagion of financial crises and Asian bond markets One of the main features of financial crises, especially those that occurred across the world in the 1990s, is that they tend to spill over from one country to neighboring countries. This was the case in the Asian Crisis, were contagion throughout the regional economies was fuelled by strong trade linkages among the East Asian countries. At the international level, some emphasize the imperfections of the international financial markets as one of the major causes of contagion (Krugman(1999), and Kaminsky, Lyons, and Schmukler(2003)). One approach to explain how contagion operates in financial crises uses the finance theory of portfolio management. Schinasi and Smith (1999) used a model of the basic portfolio theory to explain contagion selling of higher risk assets. They showed that a shock to a single assets return distribution may lead to a reduction in position of other risky assets.3 In addition, Mello and Hussein (2001) used a simple model of foreign debt portfolio management to explain that the 3 They conclude that an investor with a leveraged portfolio will reduce risky asset positions if the return on the leveraged portfolio is less than the cost of funding. 2 currency composition of a countrys foreign debt portfolio was responsive to exchange rate movements. They conducted an empirical analysis on the existence of a stable long-run relationship between the currency composition of a countrys foreign debt portfolio and exchange rate movements in the case of fourteen emerging market economies and four major currencies (the US dollar, the Deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss francs) during an analytical period of 1970-1998. Their results indicated that foreign debt portfolios were not managed optimally for the investors, in the sense that adverse movements in exchange rates were not offset by an increase in portfolio shares of debts denominated in terms of appreciating currencies.4 The Asian currency crisis of 1997-1998 brought about a strong awareness of the necessity for regional cooperation. For the reason, several policy proposals have been developed in order to strengthen regional financial cooperation. Kuroda and Kawai (2003) proposed a more effective surveillance process and considered the option of creating a common pool of foreign exchange reserves to allow flexible financial supports at times of crises and contagion, which would also reduce the problem of moral hazard. The monetary authorities in East Asian countries established and have recently developed the Chiang Mai Initiative, that is, a swap agreement in order to prevent future currency and financial crises.5 The establishment and development of regional bond markets in East Asia have been proposed in order to directly circulate regional savings into regional investments in East Asia. In addition, the possibility of introducing a common currency or a common currency basket unit as a new regional financial architecture in East Asia is also often discussed.6 In order to assess the effectiveness of basket currency denominated bonds in East Asian countries, Ogawa and Shimizu (2002, 2004) conducted an empirical analysis from the standpoint of the bond issuers and foreign investors side. A comparison was made between the G3 currency basket (a currency basket of the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen) denominated bonds and each of the single local currency denominated bonds of East Asian currencies and three major currencies in terms of both relative risk and liquidity. The results showed that issuing currency basket denominated bonds contributes to reducing foreign exchange risk for bond issuers in East Asian countries, except for the dollar-pegging countries of Malaysia, China, and Hong Kong. In Ogawa and Shimizu (2002, 2004), the G3 currency basket was used as the currency of denomination of Asian bonds. However, another type of currency basket, that is, the AMU, a composition of local currencies in East Asia, may also be considered (Shimizu and Ogawa (2005)). In 4 This is particularly true in the case of Japanese yen denominated foreign debt. The persistent appreciation of the Japanese yen vis--vis the US dollar has not made investors reduce the volume of Japanese yen denominated debt in their portfolios. These findings may be attributed to some rigidity in the currency composition of foreign debts, which impose constraints on portfolio diversification for investors. 5 The Chiang Mai Initiative, agreed in May 2000, created bilateral swap agreements worth $40 billion. 6 As for the existing research concerning the common currency basket system, Ito, Ogawa, and Sasaki (1999), Bnassy-Qur (1999), Williamson (2000), Ogawa and Ito (2002) and Ogawa, Ito and Sasaki (2002)) are listed. 3 doing so, it is important to recognize the risk properties of AMU denominated bonds, and thus, the objective of this paper is to investigate the risk properties of AMU denominated bonds for foreign investors who evaluate their returns in terms of their own currencies, such as the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen. 3. Foreign exchange risks for bond issuers 3-1 Methodology and data In Ogawa and Shimizu (2004), we investigated how much foreign exchange risks bond issuers would face when they issue bonds denominated in terms of various currencies. Our analysis focused on the volatility of foreign borrowing costs for various currencies denominated bonds. 7 We compared those volatilities for each of nine East Asian countries (Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, and China) among currency denomination in terms of three major currencies (the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen) and several types of currency basket denominated bonds. The currency baskets were supposed to be composed of the three major currencies. Regarding basket shares of the three major currencies in a currency basket, we supposed some types of basket shares that are based on the exchange rate movements and the trade weights. We assumed several patterns of share in currency baskets. We applied the trade weights of the nine East Asian countries with the United States, Japan, and the euro area countries as the basket shares. We consider two types of basket shares. One of them is the common basket share in the East Asian region as a whole. The reason why we consider the common basket share in East Asian countries is reflected by a proposal of so-called the Asian Monetary Unit (AMU) (Kawai, Ogawa, and Ito (2004), Ogawa and Shimizu (2005)). Just like the European Currency Unit (ECU) under the European Monetary System during the period from 1979 to 1998, the monetary authorities of East Asian countries should consider to create a regional common unit of account that could be a basket of regional currencies in future. We supposed two different kinds of trade weights, named trade-weights I and II depend on the calculation methods of Ogawa and Kawasaki (2003) as a common basket share. Their trade weights are the share of total trade amount of ASEAN+4 (Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China) with the United States, Japan, and the euro area countries. A difference between trade-weights I and II is whether the trade weights include the trade amounts of the nine East Asian countries with the rest of the world. The trade-weight I is based on a trade share of total trade amounts in the nine East Asian countries only with each of the United States, Japan, and the euro area countries. The 7 Usually ex ante borrowing costs in the real world should be calculated from the prevailing benchmark interest rate, risk premium, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, our aim is comparing the risk of several currency types of borrowing costs for one country, so we regard that risk premium is common for one country and concentrate the foreign exchange risk only here. 4 trade-weight II is based on a trade share that includes trade amounts with the rest of the world other than the United States, Japan, and the euro area countries. We put them into the share of the United States by assuming that the trade amounts with the rest of the world are invoices in terms of the US dollar. We calculated both trade weights by using annual data and apply the average share of annual results during the period from 1990 to 2002. The currency basket shares based on trade-weights I and II are calculated as the US dollar : the Japanese yen : the euro = 35.7% 35.1%29.2% and 69.3%16.7%14.0%, respectively. Another type of basket shares is a country-specific basket share for each of East Asian countries. In order to reflect their own characteristics of the trade relationship with three major countries, we applied the basket share based on trade volume, so-called trade intensity, which is calculated by the method of Petri (1993).8 The index of trade intensity, which can measure the bilateral trade linkages among countries (or regions), is defined as follows: Ij,k = (Tj,k/Tj)/(Tk/Tw) (1) where Ij,k is the index of trade intensity between country j and country k, Tj,k is the trade volume of country j with country k, Tj is the total trade volume of country j, Tk is the total trade volume of country k, and Tw is the total trade volume in the world. A situation where the index of trade intensity is a unity can be interpreted as a neutral bilateral trade relationship. The index of trade intensity measures the closeness of bilateral trade linkage between countries j and k by comparing it with their trade volumes with the rest of the world. In the case where the index of trade intensity is over or under a unity, it means that the trade relationship is biased in comparison with the trade with the rest of the world. Values over a unity mean that the trade relationship between countries j and k is biased toward stronger interdependence than the trades with the rest of the world. On one hand, values under a unity mean that their trade relationship is biased toward weaker interdependence than the trades with the rest of the world. We used an index of trade intensity in 2000.9 The index of trade intensity between East Asian countries and Japan are larger than a unity. The index between Indonesia and Japan is the highest while the index of trade intensity between Hong Kong and Japan is the lowest. Some indexes of trade intensity between East Asian countries and the United States are larger than a unity but smaller than those between East Asian countries and Japan. The indexes of trade intensity between East Asian countries and the Euro area countries are smaller than a unity. Thus, we made three types of currency basket share for each of the East Asian currencies. We simulated foreign borrowing costs by applying these basket shares which are calculated ex post 8 Kawai and Takagi (2000) calculated the trade intensity of East Asia and Western Europe. It can be found that intensity is extremely high in many trading pairs in East Asia, frequently exceeding the corresponding figures in European pairs. 9 See Table 1 for the results of trade intensity of East Asian countries in 2000. All trade data except Taiwan are from the Direction of Trade Statistics (IMF). The data of Taiwan are from the National Statistics of Taiwan. 5 since our purpose is to indicate how the currency basket denominated bonds work to reduce the foreign exchange risks empirically. Applying those different types of currency basket share, we can investigate not only whether the supposed currency basket denominated bonds would more effectively contribute to decreasing the volatilities of foreign borrowing costs but also which type of currency basket would be more effective in decreasing the volatilities for bond issuers in each of the East Asian countries. Both 3 months money market interest rates and daily closing of exchange rates were used to calculate the series of foreign borrowing costs for 3 months period (90 days). Then we calculated the means and the standard deviations of these series for whole sample period. The standard deviation is regarded as the volatilities of the foreign borrowing costs. The 3 months foreign borrowing costs evaluated in terms of issuers home currency were calculated under the uncovered condition. For example, 3 months foreign borrowing costs from the United States for issuers in country A are calculated as follows: 3 months foreign borrowing costs = ( ) }{ ( ) ( ) ( )%$US/A$US $US/Ar$US t daystus,month 1001 1 360 9011 903            + + (2) where ( ) t$US A : the exchange rate of the US dollar vis--vis currency A at period t. Our empirical analysis covered a period from 2 January 1999 to 31 December 2002. We calculated both 3 months foreign borrowing costs for each day during the period. As a result, we have 979 observations for each type of borrowing pattern during the analytical period.10 At first, we investigated 3 months foreign borrowing costs for the nine East Asian countries that include Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, and China. For each of the countries, we calculated eight different types of foreign borrowing costs during the whole sample period by issuing bonds denominated in terms of four single currencies, which include home currency, the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and in terms of four types of currency baskets. Issuing the currency basket denominated bonds is regarded as issuing a kind of portfolio of bonds denominated in terms of the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen. 3-2 Results - Foreign borrowing costs for bond issuers in nine East Asian countries - Table 2 shows means and standard deviations of 3 months foreign borrowing costs when borrowers in each of the nine East Asian countries issue bonds denominated in terms of the home 10 All data were obtained from Datastream. Exchange rates are daily closing rates and interest rates are the middle rate of 3 months money market rate. The details of the data are as follows: US TB 3 months, Japan CD 3 months (new issue), euro Interbank 3 months, Singapore Interbank 3 months (MAS), Thailand Deposit 3 months, Malaysia Interbank 3 months, Indonesia Deposit 3 months, Philippine Treasury Bill 91 days, Taiwan Money Market 90 days, Korea Commercial Paper 91 days, Hong Kong Interbank 3 months, China Time Deposit Rate 3months. 6 currency, the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the eight different types of the currency basket.11 We regarded the foreign borrowing cost in terms of the US dollar as a benchmark and statistically test the difference of mean and standard deviation between bond denominated in terms of the US dollar and bond denominated in terms of currency basket.12 13 Those results provide us with two important evidences. First, the standard deviations of foreign borrowing cost by issuing home currency denominated bonds are far lower than those by issuing foreign currency denominated bonds for the nine East Asian countries. It implies that the foreign exchange risks weigh heavily on the foreign borrowing costs risk of issuing the foreign currency denominated bonds. Second, foreign borrowings by issuing the currency basket denominated bonds could contribute to decreasing the foreign borrowing costs and their risks. The volatilities of foreign borrowing costs by issuing the currency basket denominated bonds are lower than those by issuing the US dollar denominated bonds for Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Korea since the foreign exchange risks of the three major currencies are partially offset each other. The foreign borrowing costs by issuing the currency basket denominated bonds are lower than those by issuing the US dollar denominated bond for all of the sample countries. Especially for dollar-pegging countries, the foreign borrowing costs by issuing the currency basket denominated bonds are lower than those by issuing the home currency denominated bonds. Accordingly, issuing the currency basket denominated bonds could make both the foreign borrowing costs and their volatilities much lower than those by issuing the US dollar denominated bonds in many cases. Foreign exchange risks of foreign borrowing costs by issuing the home currency denominated bonds are the smallest for bond issuers in all of the nine East Asian countries. The currency basket denominated bonds has the second lowest foreign exchange risks of foreign borrowing costs for bond issuers in the East Asian countries except for the Philippines and the three dollar-pegging countries, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and China. On one hand, currency basket denominated bonds would, in general, reduce the foreign borrowing costs for bond issuers in all of the East Asian countries. Especially for bond issuers in the three dollar-pegging countries, the foreign borrowing costs of the currency basket denominated bonds are lower than those of home currency denominated bonds. The foreign borrowing costs of the currency basket denominated bonds with the country-specific share based on the trade intensity are the lowest for bond issuer in all of the East Asian countries. The volatilities of the currency basket denominated bonds with the common share 11 We can provide scattered diagrams which show the relationship between mean and standard deviation by e-mail for any reader who is interested in details. 12 The standard deviations might be undervalued because we calculate them by using overlapping data. However, we just relatively compared these values rather than evaluate their absolute value. We conducted tests of differences among the standard deviations of foreign borrowing costs by issuing different type of bonds. The tests correspond to the relative comparisons among the different type of bonds. Accordingly, we regard that our tests have no problem even though we used the overlapping data. 13 We use students t and Tukey-Kramer HSD statistics for the test that the mean are equal, and OBrien test, Brown-Forsythe test and Levene test for the test that the variances are equal. 7 based on the trade-weight II are the lowest for bond issuers in most of the East Asian countries.14 The currency basket share based on trade-weight II would the most effectively contribute to decreasing the volatilities for bond issuers in Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan. The currency basket share based on trade-weight I would the most effectively contribute to decreasing the volatilities for bond issuers in Indonesia. The currency basket share based on trade intensity would the most effectively contribute to decreasing the volatilities for Korea. These results suggest that an optimal share of currency basket should be based on the trade relations between each of the East Asian countries and its trading partner countries although it might be difficult to fix a common share of currency basket among the East Asian countries in establishing an Asian bond market. 4. Foreign exchnage risks for foreign investors In Shimizu and Ogawa (2005), we calculated the returns of local currency denominated bonds also for foreign investors and evaluate their risk properties by using yield data of benchmark local bonds issued in the nine East Asian countries of the ASEAN5 countries, Japan, China, Korea, and Hong Kong. A partial equilibrium approach was applied to analyzing an investor model under the assumption that interest rates and exchange rates are taken as given (therefore returns and risks are taken as given). This means that investors behavior affects bond returns and risks. We treated bonds as an asset class in isolation to all other assets in order that we should consider AMU denominated bonds as well as US dollar denominated bonds or local currency denominated bonds, as an object of investment for foreign investors. In addition to the standard deviation of bond returns, we used the Sharpe ratio as an indicator of risk since we focus solely on bond portfolios from the standpoint of sub-optimal principal-agent reasons. Also, it is useful to measure risk-adjusted performance among the various kinds of bonds. The Sharpe ratio is basically a measure of portfolio returns, and AMU denominated bonds themselves are considered to be a type of portfolio fund. 15 In order to make the source of returns clear, we divide bond returns into interest returns and foreign exchange returns. We compared the returns of the AMU denominated bonds to each of the local currency denominated bonds in terms of interest rate and foreign exchange risks. 4-1. Risk properties of single local currency denominated bonds in East Asia Table 3 shows the details of the yield data of benchmark bonds in the nine East Asian countries denominated in terms of the local currency. First, we calculated returns for international investors who evaluate their returns in terms of the major currencies. We supposed that there are 14 We calculate and compare the volatilities of the daily borrowing costs instead of 3month borrowing costs with same data and same sample periods. The results of daily borrowing costs indicate that the most effective share of currency basket is the share based on the estimated-weights in the East Asian countries except Malaysia and Indonesia 15 Actually, the type of the fund of funds, which invests in a portfolio of several funds (or investment trusts), is becoming more common and increasingly popular for private investors in Japan recently. 8 two types of international investors: US investors, who evaluate their returns in terms of US dollars, and Japanese investors, who evaluate their returns in terms of Japanese yen. We show average returns, standard deviation of returns, and the ratio of returns to risk (the Sharpe ratio) for each of the bonds. For an investor who evaluates returns in terms of US dollars, returns on investing in bonds were calculated as follows: the investor exchanges an initial fund of US dollars into a local currency at the relevant exchange rate, purchases local currency denominated bonds at a price in terms of the local currency, holds them for one month, sells them at their price in terms of the local currency one month later, and exchanges the revenue in terms of the local currency into US dollars. 16 17 The returns are then divided into interest rate (bonds yield) returns and foreign exchange returns. A similar calculation is conducted for investors who evaluate their returns in terms of Japanese yen. Our formula for calculating the value of a local currency denominated bond in terms of US dollars for a one month investment is represented as follows: ( ) ( ) 1 1 1 100 1 100 100 100 100 t t t t t t t t t E YBondValue USdollarEquivalent E E Y E E E + + +   +=     = + +         (3) (= principal + interest return + foreign exchange return) where Et is the closing rate of the foreign exchange rate against the US dollar at month t, and Yt is the closing rate of bond yields on a monthly basis at month t. The interest returns for each of the bonds are calculated from yield data of local bonds, and foreign exchange returns are calculated from actual ex-post returns which are uncovered by forward transactions at the beginning of the month and realized when the bond values are converted to US dollars at the end of the month. Values of local currency denominated bonds in terms of Japanese yen for one month investments are calculated in the same way as in terms of US dollars. Table 4 shows bonds values and returns of local currency denominated bonds for one month investments evaluated in terms of US dollars. The data during the sample period clearly show that the standard deviations of bond value of the dollar-pegging countries (Malaysia, China, and Hong Kong) are far lower than the other countries. Their fluctuations are mainly attributed to fluctuations in interest returns for bonds issued in terms of the dollar-pegged currencies. The standard deviation of Hong Kong dollar denominated bonds is the highest among the three dollar-pegging countries. 16 We supposed the case in which investors do not use forward swap transactions for covering foreign exchange risk. 17 We supposed each local bond as a zero coupon bond. In addition, the yield data are rate on annual basis, so we convert them to a monthly basis for calculation. 9 The standard deviations of bond value for the non-dollar-pegging countries are relatively high in comparison with the dollar-pegging countries, and they are mainly attributed to fluctuations in foreign exchange returns, which are far larger than those of interest returns. Among the non-dollar-pegging countries, Singaporean bonds have the lowest standard deviation of bond value (1.35%), Japanese bonds have the highest (2.51%), and Korean bonds have the second highest value (2.45%).18 Korean bonds have the highest average of bond value (100.56), while Malaysian bonds have the lowest (100.25). The Sharpe ratios of the dollar-pegged currency denominated bonds are much larger than those of the non-dollar-pegged currency denominated bonds. Among the non-dollar-pegged currency denominated bonds, the Philippine bonds have the lowest Sharpe ratio (0.16), and the Singaporean and Korean bonds have the highest (0.23). Table 5 shows bond values and returns of single local currency denominated bonds for investments evaluated in terms of Japanese yen. In contrast to investments evaluated in terms of US dollars, the standard deviations of bond value are not so different between the dollar-pegging countries and the others, and their levels are much higher than those of bond value returns in terms of US dollars. Excluding Japanese bonds, the Singaporean bonds have the lowest standard deviation (2.40%), while Philippine bonds have the highest (3.34%) among the local bonds. The fluctuations are mainly attributed to fluctuations in foreign exchange returns. Korean bonds have the highest average of bond value (100.44), while Malaysian bonds have the lowest (100.15). As for the Sharpe ratio, Korean bonds have the highest value (0.15), and Malaysian bonds have the lowest (0.05), though there is little difference between them. 4-2. Risk properties of AMU denominated bonds When we simulated returns of AMU denominated bonds which are composed of the nine East Asian countries government bonds to investigate their risk properties, we needed to choose allocation of weights to each countrys government bond. An AMU denominated bonds which are composed of an equal share of each of the East Asian countries government bonds was assumed as a benchmark. This is an abstraction from the case of real-world international bond funds, which investors often use as an index for international portfolio investments, in which their composition weights are practically based on their size of market capitalization or outstanding of bonds.19 Table 6 shows the current outstanding of East Asian government bonds in the market. It indicates that the current outstanding of Japanese government bonds is much larger than the other East Asian countries, meaning that Japanese bonds would occupy an extremely large part of the AMU denominated bonds if we decided its composition on the basis of the current outstanding of the government bonds in market. 18 Due to the lack of sample number, we do not compare the standard deviations of Chinese and Indonesian bonds. 19 For example, the Asian Dollar Bond Index (ADBI) of HSBC is calculated on the basis of shares of the total market capital in each of East Asian countries. 10 In addition to the equally-weighted AMU, we calculated two more kinds of AMUs, each with different country weights. Instead of the above data, we used two kinds of quarterly data on external debts classified by country and obtained from the Quarterly Review of BIS: International Debt Securities by Nationality of Issuer (Table 12A in the Quarterly Review), and International Bonds Notes by Country of Residence (Table 14B in the Quarterly Review). Based on this data, we calculate two patterns of country weights, BIS1 and BIS2, shown in Table 7 and Table 8 respectively. We next used these three types of AMU denominated bonds to simulate their returns for US and Japanese investors in the same way as was done for single local currency denominated bonds. Our formula for calculating the value of AMU denominated bonds in terms of US dollars for a one month investment is represented as follows:20 ( )9 , , 1,1 9 9 , , , 1, 1,1 1 100 1 100 100100 100 t i t i t i t ii t i t i t i i i t i t ii i E Y BondValue USdollarEquivalent w E E Y Ew wE E += + += =    + =          = +  +                (4) (= principal + interest return + foreign exchange return) where Et,I is the closing rate of the oreign exchange rate of country i against the US dollar at month t, and Yt,I is the closing rate of bonds yield of country i on a monthly basis at month t. Values of the AMU denominated bonds in terms of Japanese yen for one month investment are calculated in the same way as in terms of US dollars. At first we compare the AMU denominated bonds with single local currency denominated bonds in terms of risk and Sharpe ratio. Table 9 shows bond values, returns, and risks evaluated in terms of US dollars. The standard deviation of the equally weighted AMU denominated bonds is lower than those of each government bond in the six non-dollar-pegging East Asian countries. There are two reasons for the equally weighted AMU bonds risk reducing ability. Firstly, there is a large reduction of foreign exchange risk due to the equal sharing of government bonds of all the countries, therefore foreign exchange risk is reduced through the portfolio effect. Secondly, the inclusion of the Japanese, Malaysian and Singaporean government bonds reduces interest risk because their interest rates are quite stable. The Sharpe ratio (0.36) substantially exceeds those of each of the government bonds of non-dollar-pegging countries. The results suggest that for the investors who evaluate their returns in terms of US dollars, both foreign exchange risk and interest risk are reduced by investing in AMU denominated bonds rather than each of the local currency denominated bonds. There exist differences in standard deviations among the three types of AMU denominated 20 We supposed the AMU denominated Asian bond as a portfolio investment into the nine East Asian countries government bond in this paper. 11 bonds, with the standard deviation of the BIS1 type of AMU denominated bonds having the highest value (2.08%). This is because the weight attributed to Japanese government bonds is 50 % to 70%, which is relatively higher than the others. With the exception of Singapore (1.35%), the standard deviation of the BIS2 type of AMU denominate bonds (1.68%) is lower than the return of investing into single currency denominated bonds of the non-dollar-pegging countries. The share of Japanese government bonds in the BIS2 type of AMU denominated bonds is 30% to 50%, which is still higher than the equally-weighted AMU denominated bonds. The results suggest that a smaller share of the Japanese government bonds is better for investors who evaluate their returns in terms of US dollars because the returns of Japanese government bonds are low with high fluctuations. 21 Table 10 shows that, excluding Japanese bonds, the standard deviation of AMU denominated bonds for investors who evaluate their returns in terms of Japanese yen are lower than those of the single local currency denominated bonds. Also, with the exception of Japanese and Korean bonds, their Sharpe ratios are higher than the single local currency denominated bonds, indicating that investors who evaluate their returns in terms of Japanese yen can improve their return par unit risk by investing in AMU denominated bonds. Among the three types of AMU denominated bonds, the BIS1 type of AMU denominated bonds have the lowest standard deviation (0.86%) and the highest Sharpe ratio (0.19). This is because the BIS1 type of AMU denominated bonds the highest share of Japanese government bonds. The results suggest that, for the investors who evaluate their returns in terms of the Japanese yen, a higher share of Japanese government bonds has a reducing effect on risk. Such investors could obtain less risky and more profitable outcomes by investing in AMU denominated bonds because they consist of both East Asian government bonds, whose returns and risks are high, and Japanese government bonds, whose returns and risks are quite low. 5. The foreign exchange risk reduction effect of the AMU denominated bonds In the previous sections, we conducted a simulation analysis to show that investors would be able to reduce the risk of investment returns by investing in AMU denominated bonds. In this section, we focus specifically on foreign exchange risk and give a theoretical explanation on how investing in AMU denominated bonds can contribute to reducing foreign exchange risk. International portfolio diversification is widely practiced by investors who seek to reduce their investment risks. Recently, international investors have been turning to foreign markets to obtain greater scope for diversification than can be offered in domestic markets. However, when investing in foreign currency denominated bonds it is important to consider, not only the portfolio effects on interest returns and risks, but also foreign exchange returns and risks. 21 In this paper we focus on the risks and returns of bonds. However, higher share of the Japanese bond should be desirable if we take into account other factors such as the transaction cost, grade and liquidity in the market. 12 To expand on this, at first, we use a basic portfolio theory to explain the portfolio effect on reducing investment risks. A return (Rp) of portfolio investment in bonds of country i (its return is Ri) with its share w~ at time t is represented as follows:.  = = n i t,it,p Rw~R 1 (5) where ( )nw,w,ww~ 21= . This portfolio has the following expected returns and variance: ( ) w~w~ w w ,, ,, w,,w wn T nnnn,n n, n j,i ijp i iip 1 21 11211 1 2 1 =                       = = =   =      (6) where i is the expectation value of Ri, i2 is the variance of Ri, ij is the covariance with Ri andR, ij is the correlation coefficient with Ri and R, and  is the variance-covariance matrix of ij. Then we separate the variance ( ) of the portfolio return into a sum of variances and a sum of covariance as follows: 2 pV (7)  <= += ji ijji n i iip wwwV 2 1 222 The portfolio effect means that the variance of portfolio returns should be smaller when investors increase the diversity of bonds, because fluctuations in each bonds return partly cancels out with each other. We can use the portfolio theory to examine the portfolio effect on foreign exchange risk of AMU denominated bonds for international investors, so in this section we focus on how AMU denominated bonds can reduce foreign exchange risk. The variance of returns from the equally weighted AMU denominated bonds is represented as follows: 211 2 1 22  <= +      = ji ij n i ip nnn n 1 = (average of ) + 2i ( ) 2 1 n nn  (average of ij ) (8) 13 In the above equation, the first term is the average of foreign exchange risk of each of the local government bonds. The AMU denominated bonds are composed of the non-dollar-pegging countries government bonds and the dollar-pegging countries government bonds. The former have a high foreign exchange risk while the latter have a nearly zero exchange risks against the US dollar. Accordingly, the foreign exchange risk of investing AMU denominated bonds is substantially lower than that of investing in individual local government bonds in non-dollar-pegging countries. The second term is almost equal to an average of covariance of exchange rate returns among the local government bonds. The covariance ( ) is described as follows: ij (9) jiijij = If the correlation coefficient is negative and, in turn, ij ij also is negative, portfolio investments reduce foreign exchange risk more. The AMU denominated bonds consist of the dollar-pegged currency denominated bonds and the non-dollar-pegged currency denominated bonds. Even for the non-dollar-pegging countries in East Asia, their currencies are highly correlated movements in the US dollar. Correlation coefficients among East Asian currencies, especially the dollar-pegged currencies and the Japanese yen tend to be negative in terms of the foreign exchange returns. Table 13 and Table 14 show correlation coefficient matrixes of investing in government bonds in terms of US dollars during one and six-month periods respectively. Both of the tables show that most of the correlation coefficients between the dollar-pegging countries and the non-dollar-pegging countries are negative. Accordingly, for investors who evaluate their returns in terms of US dollars, the AMU denominated bonds should be effective in reducing foreign exchange risk. For investors who evaluate their returns in terms of Japanese yen, the average of foreign exchange risk in the first term could be reduced by including the Japanese government bonds in the AMU denominated bonds. The higher is the share of the Japanese government bonds; the lower is the foreign exchange risk of the AMU denominated bonds. Accordingly, the AMU denominated bonds are likely to have the portfolio effect of reducing foreign exchange risks for Asian bonds regardless of whether the investor evaluates returns in terms of US dollars or Japanese yen. 6. Liquidity in Asian bond markets In Ogawa and Shimizu (2004), liquidity were compared among bonds denominated in terms of the three major currencies and the East Asian currencies. Due to constraints of data on bid-ask spreads in bond markets across the all sampled countries, we used the bid-ask spreads in foreign exchange markets as a measure of liquidity.22 Another reason why we regard the foreign exchange 22 A commentator indicates that the bid-ask spreads in foreign exchange forward swap market account for the hedging costs. 14 bid-ask spreads as a measure of liquidity in the Asian bond markets is that bond issuers must deal spot and forward transaction in the foreign exchange market in order to exchange their foreign borrowings into their home currencies and that their choice of bond denomination currency should be affected by the bid-ask spreads in current foreign exchange market.23 Bid-ask spreads are caused by three factors: (1) order-processing costs, (2) inventory holding costs, and (3) information costs for market-making (Hartmann (1998)). In terms of order processing costs, economies of scale work because fixed costs of purchasing electric market information are needed for processing orders. In terms of inventory holding cost, average costs of holding inventory are diminishing by the law of large numbers as statistically independent orders increase. Also economies of scale work because of substantial fixed information costs for market-making. Thus, a large volume of trading in liquid markets reduces their bid-ask spreads through the three factors. Basically, bid-ask spreads in the major currencies vis--vis the US dollar and frequently quoted major cross currencies, such as the euro vis--vis the Japanese yen, the Sterling pound vis--vis the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc vis--vis the Japanese yen and the Sterling pound vis--vis the euro, are very narrow and costless. On the other hand, so-called exotic currencies such as other East Asian currencies have some inconvenience and higher transaction costs to exchange directly with non-US dollar currencies, especially in forward outright trading. It is usual that the East Asian currencies are quoted against the US dollar in foreign exchange market and not against the euro or the Japanese yen. Therefore, we calculated cross rates of the East Asian currencies vis--vis the Japanese yen by using exchange rates of the US dollar vis--vis the Japanese yen and the US dollar vis--vis East Asian currencies. We took the same procedure to calculate cross rates of East Asian currencies vis--vis the euro by using exchange rates of the US dollar vis--vis the euro and the US dollar vis--vis East Asian currencies. Also in the case of quoting forward outright rate, we took the same procedure to calculate cross swap rates. Accordingly, the bid-ask spreads of East Asian currencies forward outright rates vis--vis the euro or the Japanese yen are wider in comparison with the other major currencies. This seems to be a reason why borrowers in the East Asian countries did not use their swap transactions to cover their foreign borrowings in terms of foreign currencies especially before the Asian currency crises in 1997. We compared the bid-ask spreads in forward swap rates of the seven East Asian currencies vis--vis the three major currencies, and the euro and the Japanese yen vis--vis the US dollar. In order to compare the bid-ask spreads, we expressed them in two different terms, percentage of transaction-based cost and one of daily based costs. The transaction-based cost means how much we have to pay the bid-ask spread to deal one forward outright transaction and the daily based cost means how much the per-day cost of one forward outright transaction is. We calculated those bid-ask spreads of eight East Asian currencies in terms of 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months 23 We consider bid-ask spread and foreign borrowing cost separately since bid-ask spread should not be included in to the foreign borrowing cost itself since it is one of the transaction costs. 15 vis--vis the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen. In order to compare with the bid-ask spreads of major traded currencies, we calculate those of the euro and the Japanese yen vis--vis the US dollar and the Japanese yen vis--vis the euro, too. We used the spot rates and forward rates collected from Bloomberg Currency Composite pages and the brokers page of Prebon Yamane Asia Region on Bloomberg dated on 13 September 2002 and 6 February 2003. Table 12 shows the transaction based bid-ask spreads. The bid-ask spreads for all of the East Asian currencies vis--vis the US dollar are the lowest in all period, while the bid-ask spreads for all of the East Asian currencies vis--vis the euro are highest in terms of 1 and 3 months. In addition, the bid-ask spreads for all of the East Asian currencies are far higher than those of the euro and the Japanese yen vis--vis the US dollar. The bid-ask spreads of the euro and the Japanese yen vis--vis the US dollar are 3 to 4 basis points (bp)24 for one transaction, while those of the East Asian currencies vis--vis the US dollar are from the lowest of 5 bp for the Taiwan dollar to the highest of almost 50 bp for the Philippine peso and the Indonesian rupiah vis--vis the US dollar and above 50 bp vis--vis the euro. The bid-ask spreads for all of the East Asian currencies vis--vis the euro and the Japanese yen are almost 3 to 4 bp higher than those vis--vis the US dollar, and are higher than those of the Japanese yen vis--vis the euro, too. As for the differences due to terms, there are not so much differences in the bid-ask spreads between 1 month, 3 months and 6 months for the Hong Kong dollar, the Singapore dollar, the Thai baht and the Korean won same as for the euro and the Japanese yen. On the other hand, the bid-ask spreads for the rest of the East Asian currencies become higher as the terms become longer. Table 13 shows the daily based bid-ask spreads. As the daily based bid-ask spreads are equivalent of the transaction based bid-ask spreads divided by the number of days, they tend to reduce as the terms become longer. Comparing the differences in the bid-ask spreads vis--vis the US dollar and vis--vis the euro or the Japanese yen, the differences between the lowest and the highest are 0.06 bp to 0.15 bp for 1 month swap transaction, 0.02 bp to 0.06 bp for 3 months swap transaction, and 0.01 bp to 0.03 bp for 6 month swap transaction. Comparing the differences in the bid-ask spreads of the East Asian currencies vis--vis the euro or the Japanese yen and those of the Japanese yen vis--vis the euro, the differences between the lowest and the highest are 0.01 bp to 0.84 bp for 1 month swap transaction, 0.01 bp to 0.4 bp for 3 months swap transaction, and 0 bp to 0.28 bp for 6 month swap transaction. These results shows that the differences of the daily based bid-ask spreads between the East Asian currencies and the major trading currencies become more trivial as the terms are longer. Among the eight East Asian currencies, the Hong Kong dollar, and the Taiwan dollar have the lowest bid-ask spreads. The next lowest bid-ask spread currencies include the Singapore dollar, the Thai baht, and the Korean won. On the other hand, the highest bid-ask spread currencies include the Malaysian ringgit, the Philippine peso, and the Indonesian rupiah. It is interesting that in the 24 1 basis point (bp) =1/100 percent 16 Malaysian ringgit has the highest bid-ask spread among the nine East Asian countries on the sample day of September 13, 2002. It seems that there is not much demand to trade forward swap in the Malaysian ringgit because the monetary authorities of Malaysia have been adopting the dollar peg system by pegging the spot rate of the Malaysian ringgit to the US dollar. As explained earlier, investment into the currency basket denominated bonds means a portfolio investment into the bonds denominated in terms of the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen. It is possible to use weighted averages of the bid-ask spreads for the three currencies as a proxy of the currency basket denominated bonds. The averaged based differences in the bid-spreads between the US dollar and the currency basket are 0.07 bp to 0.08 bp for 1 month swap transaction, 0.02 bp to 0.03 bp for 3 months swap transaction, and 0 bp to 0.01 bp for 6 month swap transaction. Thus, we used data on the bid-ask spreads of swap transactions to compare liquidity among the three major currencies and the currency basket. It proved that the US dollar has the highest degree of liquidity for all of the nine East Asian currencies. However, the differences between the US dollar and the currency basket are not so large especially for 3 and 6 months swap transactions though the differences are large for 1 month swap transactions. Next, we choose two of the East Asian currencies, the Singapore dollar and the Thai baht, which are relatively active in trading currencies in East Asian markets. We calculate forward bid-ask spreads vis--vis the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen once a year from 1999 to 2003 for the currencies. Table 14 shows the change of transaction based forward bid-ask spreads from 1999 to 2003. Comparing the same calculation for the euro and the Japanese yen vis--vis the US dollar and the Japanese yen vis--vis the euro, it is clear that the bid-ask spreads of the two East Asian currencies become lower. For example, 6 months bid-ask spreads for the Singapore dollar vis--vis the Japanese yen was 16 bp in June 20, 1999, and it was 8 bp in February 6, 2003, which is almost same level with the bid-ask spread for the Japanese yen vis--vis the euro. Similarly 6 months bid-ask spreads for the Thai baht vis--vis the Japanese yen was 36 bp on June 20, 1999, and it was 7 bp on February 6, 2003, which is slightly better than the bid-ask spread for the Japanese yen vis--vis the euro. It means that the conditions of foreign exchange markets in East Asian countries are improving, and the forward outright deals of major East Asian currencies are becoming less expensive to trade recently. 7. Conclusion This paper explained advantages and disadvantages of choosing a common currency basket such as the AMU over an international currency as a denomination currency for bond issuers and foreign investors in terms of both foreign exchange risks and liquidity. Here, a common currency basket was regarded as a regional currency according to some of the earlier literature. Performance of the currency basket denominated bonds was compared with that bonds denominated in terms of the three major currencies that include the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen. 17 Issuing the currency basket denominated bonds has the second lowest foreign exchange risks of foreign borrowing costs in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Korea. The foreign exchange risks are smaller than those in the case of issuing the US dollar denominated bonds. Moreover, currency basket denominated bonds would, in general, reduce the foreign borrowing costs for bond issuers in all of the East Asian countries. Especially for bond issuers in the dollar-pegging countries, the foreign borrowing costs of the currency basket denominated bonds are lower than those of home currency denominated bonds. Thus, issuing the currency basket denominated bonds would contribute to decreasing the foreign borrowing costs and their foreign exchange risks for bond issuers in East Asian countries. As for the shares of currency basket, we investigated the two types of basket shares which based on trade weights. One is the common basket share for bond issuers in all of the East Asian countries while the other is the country-specific basket share for bond issuers in each of the East Asian countries. The volatilities of the currency basket denominated bonds with the common basket share based on the trade-weight II are the lowest for bond issuers in most of the East Asian countries except for Indonesia and Korea. On the other hand, the means of their foreign borrowing costs are the lowest when they issue the currency basket denominated bonds with the country-specific basket share based on the trade intensity. Thus, issuing the currency basket denominated bonds would contribute to decreasing foreign borrowing costs and their foreign exchange risks in many cases. However, the US dollar denominated bond is still the best choice for bond issuers in the dollar-pegging countries. These results suggest that it might be difficult to fix a common share of currency basket across the nine East Asian countries. For both investors who evaluate their returns in terms of the US dollar and investors who evaluate their returns in terms of Japanese yen, the risk of investing in AMU denominated bonds are likely to be lower than those of investmenting in each of the local currency denominated bonds in the East Asian countries, except for the dollar-pegging countries. Especially for investors who evaluate their returns in terms of US dollars, investing in equally weighted AMU denominated bonds is effective, both in reducing risk and improving the Sharpe ratio, in comparison with investing in each of the East Asian countries government bonds, with the exception of the dollar-pegging countries. The is due to the reductin of foreign exchange risk from the portfolio effect. It is important to note, however, that these results depend on the currency system in the East Asian countries. On the other hand, the composition weight of the Japanese yen denominated bonds in the AMU denominated bonds is critical for investors who evaluate their returns in terms of Japanese yen. Due to the higher composition weight of Japanese government bonds in the BIS1 type of AMU denominated bonds, these bonds should have the lowest risk and the highest Sharpe ratio for investors who evaluate their returns in terms of the Japanese yen, in contrast to investors who evaluate their returns in terms of US dollars. In addition, for both investors who evaluate their returns in terms of US dollars and Japanese yen, the effect on the interest return from including 18 high yield bonds in AMU denominated bonds is larger for longer investment periods. When investors evaluate their returns of investing in single currency denominated government bonds, their risks depend on foreign exchange risk rather than interest risk. Therefore, the introduction of AMU denominated bonds could prevent contagion selling of local currency denominated bonds caused by a sudden depreciation of one local currency. In terms of liquidity, data on the bid-ask spreads of swap transactions shows that the US dollar has the highest degree of liquidity for bond issuers in all of the nine East Asian currencies. However, the differences between the US dollar and the currency basket are not so large especially for 3 and 6 months swap transactions though the differences are large for 1 month swap transactions. Accordingly, it is true that bond issuers in East Asia face trade-off relationship between foreign exchange risks and liquidity when they issue the currency basket denominated bonds. Although the currency basket denominated bonds would contribute to decreasing the foreign exchange risks, bond issuers might prefer the US dollar denominated bonds to the currency basket denominated bonds as long as they care about liquidity rather than foreign exchange risks. When we used forward swap bid-ask spread a measure of liquidity, we found that the forward outright deals of major East Asian currencies are less expensive to trade recently. In our analyses, we have to say that the US dollar denomination in issuing bonds provides the highest degree of liquidity due to the US dollars dominance in the world financial markets and that the US dollar denominated bonds are still the best choice especially for bond issuers in the dollar-pegging countries in East Asia. However we confirm that the currency basket denominated bonds would contribute to reducing foreign borrowing costs and their foreign exchange risks in many cases. In order to activate regional bond markets and establish more solid base for intra-regional capital flows in East Asia, we should establish markets for regional bonds denominated in terms of a common currency basket. In this paper, our results were obtained after making some simplifying assumptions in our analysis. However, these assumptions will be reconsidered in future research. Firstly, we assumed a partial equilibrium, and therefore we did not consider the possibility of bond returns and risks being affected by investors behavior. Examining the effects of the widespread adoption of AMU bonds in East Asian countries on bond returns and risks is therefore a topic for future discussion. Secondly, in this paper we focused only on the risk reduction effects of AMU denominate bonds. However, other important factors such as transaction costs, market liquidity and credit rating, all influence investors decisions, so they also need to be included in the analysis.25 Finally, our results indicate that the risk reduction effect of AMU denominated bonds largely depends on the country share, meaning that, while taking into account returns from AMU denominated bonds, further discussion on optimal share levels for risk reduction will be called for in the near future. 25 For example, concerning the influence of transaction cost, when transaction cost is required for holding overseas assets, the efficient frontier shifts to the lower part equal to the transaction cost amount and the investors utility is seemed to decrease. 19 References Bnassy-Qur, Agnes, 1999, Optimal pegs for East Asian currencies, Journal of the Japanese and International Economies, Vol. 13, 44-60.
