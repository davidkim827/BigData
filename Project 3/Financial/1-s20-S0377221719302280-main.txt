The basis of our approach is to separate the pro- duction technology into two sub-technologies. The former is the production of non-interest income and loans from a set of traditional inputs. The latter is attached to the production of interest income from loans where an explicit distinction between good and non-performing loans is introduced. Economic effi- ciency comes from the production of good outputs, namely interest and non-interest income, while credit risk management efficiency is related to the minimization of the non-performing loans that can be con- sidered as an unintended or bad output. The model is applied to Chinese financial data covering 30 banks from 2005 to 2012 and different scenarios are considered. The results indicate that income could be in- creased by an average rate of 16% while non-performing loans could be decreased by an average rate of 33%. According to our results, banking managers could strike a balance between economic performance and credit risk management and make more appropriate decisions in line with their preferences.  2019 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction The notion of risk plays a key role in banking. Its mismanage- ent by some of the worlds largest financial institutions has led o a global financial crisis that started ten years ago, but whose onsequences are still felt today. We revisit the question of risk n banking by formulating the concept of credit risk (in)efficiency nd demonstrate how to measure it jointly with the productive in)efficiency of banks using a nonparametric Data Envelopment nalysis (DEA) model of total banking (in)efficiency. A number of existing studies approximate risks inherent o banking operations using measures of asset quality, such s non-performing loans. Early papers accounting for prob- em loans as proxies for risk include Charnes, Cooper, Huang, nd Sun (1990) and Berg, Forsund, and Jansen (1992) , who  Corresponding author at: Anhui University of Finance & Economics, No. 962 aoshan Road, 233030 Bengbu, China.

More re- ently, non-performing assets have been treated as indicators of isk in Barros, Managi, and Matousek (2012), Chiu, Chen, and Bai 2011), Fujii, Managi, and Matousek (2014) and Mamatzakis (2015), uarda, Rouabah, and Vardanyan (2013) , to name just a few among number of studies approximating banking technologies. 2 Most of these and other similar studies use problem loans long with conventional inputs and outputs to assess the efficiency ationship between nonperforming loans and efficiency and conclude that the qual- ty of banks assets should be considered in some, but not all cases. 2 Provisions for loan losses and measures of risky assets have also been used as ndicators of risk instead of (or in addition to) non-performing loans to account or credit and operational risk, respectively ( Altunbas, Liu, Molyneux, & Seth, 20 0 0; hang, 1999; Charnes, Cooper, Huang, & Sun, 1990; Drake & Hall, 2003; Drake, Hall, Simpler, 2009; Mamatzakis, 2015 ). However, due to data limitations we will focus xclusively on problem loans as a proxy for risk. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.006 http://www.ScienceDirect.com http://www.elsevier.com/locate/ejor http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.006&domain=pdf mailto:jp.boussemart@ieseg.fr mailto:h.leleu@ieseg.fr mailto:zhiyang86@163.com mailto:zhiyang86@live.cn mailto:m.vardanyan@ieseg.fr mailto:ningzhu@scut.edu.cn https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.006 720 J.-P.

For example, Barros et al. (2012), Colin Glass, McKillop, and Rasaratnam (2010), Fukuyama and Weber (2008), Guarda et al. (2013), Park and Weber (2006) , and Fujii et al. (2014) have treated non-performing loans as socially undesirable byproducts or bad outputs, whose decreases at frontier points are not feasible unless accompanied by simultaneous reductions in intended or good outputs as well, assuming the inputs are held constant. This assumption, referred to as the weak disposability of good and bad outputs jointly, has been used in many existing studies to approximate pollution- generating technologies in general ( Fre & Grosskopf, 2004; Fre, Grosskopf, Noh, & Weber, 2005 ). However, the assumption of a positive association between the good and bad outputs at the frontier of technology could be diffi- cult to justify in the case of banking, where non-performing loans can be avoided provided banks always properly evaluate all loan applications. Murty, Russell, and Levkoff (2012) formulate a by- production approach for polluting technologies as a combination of two different sub-technologies  one conventional and the other polluting  thereby addressing the theoretical inconsistencies of the model based on the assumption of weak disposability of the good and bad outputs jointly. Our approach for assessing credit risk (in)efficiency in banking has been inspired both by Murty et al. (2012) ) and the network theory of production ( Fre & Grosskopf, 1996 ). The basis of our approach is to separate the production technol- ogy into two sub-technologies. The former corresponds to the pro- duction of non-interest income and loans from a set of traditional inputs. The latter is associated with the production of interest in- come from loans and allows for an explicit distinction between the good and non-performing loans. Hence, the economic efficiency is derived using the production process corresponding to the good outputs, namely interest and non-interest income, while the credit risk (in)efficiency is related to the minimization of non-performing loans, or the unintended output. In order to model the banking technology, we rely on a so- called profit efficiency model. 3 In our framework, this approach allows us to explicitly model the two banking sub-technologies, where loans are considered an intermediate output in the first sub-technology and subsequently become either an input (for good loans) or a bad output (for non-performing loans) in the sec- ond sub-technology. Charnes et al. (1990) were among the first to use such profit-oriented specification, which represents a vari- ation of the asset approach, also referred to as the intermedia- tion approach, introduced by Sealey and Lindley (1977) . More re- cently, various versions of the profit efficiency model have been applied in empirical studies by Avkiran (2011), Avkiran and Tho- raneenitiyan (2010), Sturm and Williams (2008) , and Drake, Hall, and Simpler (2006) , among others. We use Chinese banking data from 2005 to 2012 to provide an empirical illustration of our approach. Our approach for measuring banking performance represents mainly a threefold contribution. First, we demonstrate how to measure economic and credit risk inefficiency simultaneously. Sec- ond, we formulate production sub-technologies, each used to de- fine a particular type of inefficiency, whose intersection allows for such simultaneous measurement. Finally, we measure inefficiency under various scenarios corresponding to the relative importance attributed to the economic versus risk performance of banks by their managers. The rest of the article is organized as follows. In the next section, we propose a banking production technology incorpo- 3 Various approaches to modeling a baking technology have been introduced in the literature.

Methodology .1. Banking production technology with undesirable outputs We model the production technology for decision making units DMUs) using an input vector x   n + used to produce an output ector y   m + . A general banking production possibility set can be efined as follows: = { ( x , y )   n + m + , x can produce y } (1) Two major approaches usually used to select variables for mea- uring banking efficiency are the production approach ( Bell & Mur- hy, 1968; Benston, 1965 , 1968 ) and the intermediation approach Sealey & Lindley, 1977 ). However, Berger and Humphrey (1997) ar- ued that neither of these approaches can fully capture the dual oles played by banks both as providers of various banking trans- ctions and also as financial intermediaries. Therefore, the profit- riented approach, which considers both the profits earned and the osts saved in banking operations, gained popularity for selecting ariables used to evaluate banking performance (e.g. Avkiran, 2011; rake et al., 2006; Pasiouras, 2008; Zhu, Wang, Yu, & Wu, 2016 ). A ypical profit-oriented approach treats the cost components, such s the interest and non-interest expenses, as inputs, while treat- ng the revenue components, such as the interest and non-interest ncome, as outputs. In this paper, we consider a profit-oriented framework and di- ide the revenue producing process ( T ) into two sub-processes, r sub-technologies. In the case of the first sub-technology T 1 , anks use inputs x to produce a single desirable output, or non- nterest income ( NII ), along with a single intermediate output, or otal loans ( L ), which include good loans ( GL ) and non-performing oans ( NPL ). Our first sub-technology assumes the banks cannot ifferentiate between the loans of different quality, since non- erforming loans could be avoided if such distinction were pos- ible. In the case of the second sub-technology T 2 , two objec- ives are formulated simultaneously: maximizing the interest in- ome ( II ) and minimizing the exposure to credit risk. For a given evel of total loans, the latter can be achieved via the maximization f good loans together with the minimization of non-performing oans we treat as an undesirable output. Therefore, L is an input, I and GL are desirable outputs, and NPL s are undesirable outputs n T 2 , i.e.: 4 = T 1  T 2 1 = { ( x , NI I , L )   n +2 + , x can produce NII and L } 2 = { (L , I I , GL, NP L )   4 + , L can produce I I , GL, NP L } (2) To estimate the above model we formulate a non-parametric pproach that provides an operational definition of the produc- ion sets T 1 and T 2 and measures the distance to the frontiers of hese sets. We assume that our banking technology satisfied con- entional assumptions such as free disposability and convexity. To ccount for size heterogeneity among banks we assume both of ur sub-technologies exhibit variable returns to scale (VRS). Then, 4 Even though non-performing loans are our only variable approximating risk in- erent to banking, the model can be easily extended to incorporate other types of isk by formulating additional sub-technologies.

Similarly, 2 can be defined as 2 = { ( L, I I , GL, NP L )   4 + ,  K k =1 k I I k  I I ,  K k =1 k G L k  GL,  K k =1 K k =1 k L k  L,  K k =1 k = 1 , k  0  k = 1 , . . . , K here  is a vector of activity variables associated with the sub- echnology T 2 . In our framework, L is a common element appearing s part of both of our production sub-technologies, implying that he quantity of total loans produced by T 1 and consumed by T 2 hould be equivalent. Thus, we add the following constraint linking he two production processes: K k =1 k L k = K  k =1 k L k (5) The above constraint ensures that the optimal quantity of total oans is equivalent for both sub-technologies. Hence, our banking roduction technology can be defined in the following fashion: =        ( x , L, NI I , GL, NP L, II )   n +5 + ,  K k =1 k NI I k NI I ,  K k =1 k L k  L,  K k =1 k x i k  x i  i = 1 , . . . , K k =1 k I I k I I ,  K k =1 k G L k  GL,  K k =1 k NP L k  NP L,  K k =1  K k =1 k L k =  K k =1 k L k We summarize and illustrate this production process in Fig. 1 . he economic efficiency is obtained from both sub-technologies hile the risk efficiency is derived from the second sub-technology nly. We can think of this framework as a version of the by- roduction model introduced by Murty et al. (2012) , which we xtend by establishing a formal association between the two ub-technologies and using the Russel directional distance func- ion. However, our approach is also strongly related to a different trand of literature based on network models ( Fukuyama & Weber, 010, 2015, 2017, 2018; Fukuyama & Matousek, 2017, 2018 ). 5 In articular, similarities can be established in terms of the notion of sub-technology, the fashion in which two sub-technologies are elated, the use of the Russell directional distance function as well s the equivalence between it and some slack-based measures. For xample, Fukuyama and Matousek (2018) propose a similar idea f modeling production using two sub-technologies and define he technology T as their intersection, while Fukuyama and Weber 5 We thank a reviewer for pointing out this connection. t t e , (3) P L k  N P L, } , (4) K k =1 k = 1 , k  0  k = 1 , . . . , K  L,  K k =1 k = 1 , k  0  k = 1 , . . . , K,        (6) 2009) highlight the equivalence of the slack-based measures and he Russell directional distance function. In addition, the way we elate our two by-production sub-technologies using constraint (5) ears certain resemblance to the fashion in which Fukuyama and eber (2010) accomplish this task in the context of a network- ased production model when they rely on the dual mathematical rogramming program to formulate the corresponding inequality onstraint (result (7), p. 401). Our approach is different because t allows us to overlap the sub-technologies directly in the primal pace using an equality constraint. .2. Estimation of banking efficiency with a directional distance unction A directional distance function can be used to measure the dis- ance from each banks position inside the technology set T to its orresponding efficient benchmark on this sets frontier. The direc- ional output distance function was proposed by Chambers, Chung, nd Fre (1996) and is defined as follows: T ( x , y ; g ) = sup {    + , ( x , y + g )  T } , (7) here  denotes the increase in outputs necessary to reach the rontier of the banking technology in the direction given by the apping vector g . It can be interpreted as an inefficiency score, here  = 0 signals zero inefficiency and implies that the corre- ponding bank serves as a production benchmark. While  is a unique scalar as defined in ( 7 ), our approach allows s to distinguish between several components related to the eco- omic and risk inefficiency. We therefore introduce  = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) s a vector of inefficiency scores and w = ( w econ , w econ , w risk ) as n exogenous vector of weights, which specify the relative pref- rences with respect to the economic versus credit risk manage- ent performance. The economic inefficiency score is decomposed nto two different components, 1 and 2 , which measure ineffi- iency corresponding to (or shortfalls in) NII and II , respectively, hile 3 measures the credit risk inefficiency. These inefficiency cores are consequently weighted by the components of the vector in the objective function, similar to the approach proposed by thanassopoulos (1995) in the context of the Goal programming nd Data Envelopment Analysis models. For example, we can as- ign a unique weight w econ to our intended economic outputs NII nd II and a different weight, e.g. w risk , to the undesirable output PL , which approximates credit risk. By adjusting these weights, e can simulate various preferences of bank managers who must ace performance tradeoffs between profits and risk. Furthermore, we assume our direction vector is defined as = ( g T I , g T I , g NPL ) = (T I, T I, NP L ) , where g T I  the observed total in- ome, or the sum of NII and II  is the direction corresponding o the economic inefficiency score. Similarly, we assume g NPL is he actual value of our proxy for credit risk, or NPL . Hence, our conomic inefficiency score is measured as the percentage increase 722 J.-P. Boussemart, H. Leleu and Z.

Since total loans are defined as the sum of good and non-performing loans, the decrease in NPL , or 3 g NPL , must be equivalent to the increase in good loans. Hence, the directional distance function in ( 7 ) can be modified as follows: D T (x , y ; w , g ) = sup { w    : ( x , y + g )  T } (8) The directional distance function in ( 8 ) is related to the slack- based inefficiency measure described in Fukuyama and Weber (2009) , who demonstrate how the equivalence between the direc- tional distance function and a slack-based measure can be estab- lished using an appropriate direction vector and a suitable variable transformation. 6 Finally, for any DMU k , our directional output distance function can be estimated using the following linear programming problem: D T ( x k  y k  ; w , g k  ) = Max 1 , 2 , 3 ,, w econ ( 1 + 2 ) + w risk 3 s.t.

First, since the first sub-technology does not seek to optimize the level of loans, in T 1 the economic inefficiency score is derived from the banks ability to generate non-interest income from its current expenses, meaning the economic performance does not depend on the amount of loans held by the bank. In T 2 , the economic efficiency is obtained by maximizing the interest income whatever the composition of the loan portfolio for a given level of loans in the current year. In other words, our model assumes the economic efficiency is related to the current year of 6 We would like to thank one of the referees for pointing out this equivalence. t peration and the risk performance is based on the minimization f non-performing loans in the current loan portfolio. However, n reality a banks risk performance is likely to depend at least in art on its past credit policy as well, implying our model is clearly tatic in nature. Unfortunately, we are unable take the specificities f the NPL -generating process into account in our model by, or example, including the lagged values of NPL s, as this would equire much more detailed data than we have under our disposal. owever, such linking of loan portfolios over time could be an mportant extension of our approach, especially when used with elatively recent data, in light of the recommendations for a har- onized and uniform measurement of NPL s outlined in the Basel II accords ( BCBS, 2017 ). For example, regulators can rely on both he current and future level of NPL s when testing banks soundness sing specialized asset quality reviews and/or stress tests. 7 . Empirical application of Chinese banking .1. Chinese banking data In our empirical application, we rely on a sample of 30 Chinese ommercial banks representing 240 observations spanning 8 years rom 2005 to 2012. The summary statistics of the sample are given n Table 1 . The banks are divided into three categories we mention n the Appendix along with the names of the banks, i.e. the state- wned commercial banks, the joint-stock commercial banks, and he city commercial banks, allowing us to distinguish among differ- nt banking technologies. All of the data come from the Bankscope atabase, and the variables are expressed Chinese yuan with 2004 s the base year (CNY 2004 ). We assume the input vector x consists of interest expenses IE ) and non-interest expenses ( NIE ). Furthermore, recall that total oans ( L ) are an intermediate output, interest income ( II ) and non- nterest income ( NII ) are good outputs, and non-performing loans NPL ) are bad outputs. Good loans ( GL ) are obtained as the differ- nce between L and NPL . A banks capacity to loan funds depends n its level of deposits and the reserve rate, determined by the entral bank (Peoples Bank of China) and the China Banking and nsurance Regulatory Commission. A profit-maximizing bank will lways attempt to lend as much of its deposit holdings as possible. ence, we assume that banks do not hold any extra reserves and oan as much of their funds as they are allowed to. Table 1 con- ains the descriptive statistics corresponding to these variables for ll three types of banks. Looking at the last column, we note a sig- ificant fluctuation in NPL , whose coefficient of variation equals .75. Fig. 2 shows that the share of NPL among total loans has teadily decreased during the sample period for all three categories f banks and that the state-owned commercial banks have a higher hare of NPL compared to the other two types of banks. 7 See for example Baudino and Yun (2017) for an in-depth discussion of NPL s in he context of Basel III accords.

Credit risk management inefficiency measures possible reduction in non-performing loans, i.e. if 3 is 10% then non-performing loans can be reduced by the same amount. Negative values of 3 imply the corresponding bank is above the frontier of technology. v a t o m n m c i i a l a i l n s t h n i t t t m a t t i s i e m g i i t i w p t To operationalize our problem, we need to choose the fashion n which to partition the weights appearing in the objective func- ion of LP1. These weights can be interpreted as different pref- rences banks may have with respect to the two dimensions of erformance described earlier, i.e. the economic and risk perfor- ance. Although a partitioning such as w econ = w risk = 50% is an ob- ious choice, many other combinations are also possible. Thus, we onsider eleven such combinations of weights corresponding to the conomic versus credit risk performance, which are described in able 2 . .2. Empirical results We first look at the results corresponding to the average eco- omic and risk performance for each of the eleven scenarios and he entire sample, summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 3 . Results clearly ary under alternative scenarios. For example, a rise in the weight ttributed to risk performance is associated with a gradual reduc- ion in non-performing loans, which tops at 39% at the frontier f the technology when only credit risk efficiency is assumed to atter, i.e. w risk = 100%. On the contrary, a decline in w risk culmi- ates in a 52% increase in bad loans when only economic efficiency atters to bank managers. Changes in the weight associated with redit risk and control also influence the corresponding economic nefficiency, as the average potential gain in the interest and non- nterest income grows from an average of 31% when banks are ssumed to target profits with no concern for an increase in bad oans to an average of just 2% when all of the effort s are directed t controlling risk. Fig. 3 provides a summary of this relationship by illustrat- ng how policies directed at controlling risk, i.e. banking regu- ation, may cause a sharp decline in income but help reduce on-performing loans. As expected, decisions to allocate fewer re- ources to the screening of loan applications  a scenario consis- ent with relatively high values of w econ and low values of w risk  elp increase profitability but come at the expense of a simulta- eous increase in problem loans for the efficient banks. Such will- ngness to accept more non-performing assets is consistent with hese banks treatment of credit risk performance as being rela- ively unimportant under such scenarios. Furthermore, looking at he patterns of change in the economic versus credit risk perfor- ance, we can see that while the economic inefficiency decreases t a roughly constant rate as progressively more importance is at- ributed to the management of risk, the associated rate of reduc- ion in NPL s is clearly decreasing. In other words, banks find it eas- er to avoid non-performing assets as the risk performance is only tarting to matter than when w risk is already relatively high, as risk n banking  measured using NPL s or otherwise  simply cannot be liminated completely. In Fig. 4 , we present the tradeoff between economic perfor- ance and credit risk separately for each bank type. While these raphs are comparable to the pattern above, there appear to be mportant differences among the three groups we consider. Look- ng first at the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), we note hat economic inefficiency, which can be interpreted as potential ncrease in profitability, is decreasing from 11% to 5% on average, hile risk inefficiency, which implies a possible reduction in non- erforming loans, is simultaneously increasing from 0% to 20% as he share of weight attributed to risk performance grows from 0% 724 J.-P. Boussemart, H. Leleu and Z. Shen et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 277 (2019) 719726 Fig. 4. The tradeoff between economic and risk performance for various types of banks. Note: Potential improvement in economic or risk performance is plotted on the ver- tical axis and the weight corresponding to risk control is on the horizontal axis. Fig. 5. Evolution of the economic and risk performance assuming w econ = w risk = 50%. t c t t s o a c h s s i a C s & o i  r o to 100%. Also, we can see that the SOCBs experience no meaning- ful increase in credit risk inefficiency beyond the scenario where w risk = 30% and w econ = 70%, while the associated economic ineffi- ciency gains remain roughly constant at approximately 10% of to- tal income regardless of how one partitions the preferences for the two types of performance. Considering the SOCBs have histor- ically had a relatively large share of problem loans on their books ( Fig. 2 ), making it at least possible for these institutions to have improved their credit risk performance in a more meaningful fash- ion, this result could be explained by the role the SOCBs play in the Chinese economy as key providers of credit. Bearing in mind their status of state-owned credit institutions, it is possible the SOCBs are expected to provide loans to a relatively wide array of economic agents, including those possessing less-than perfect credit rating, even when credit risk performance matters a lot to these banks. Furthermore, we see that decisions to assign any particular weight can have a significant impact on the economic performance and the management of risk in the case of the joint-stock commer- cial banks (JSCBs) and the city commercial banks (CCBs) as well, and that the sensitivity to changes in w and w econ is clearly not risk he same compared to the SOCBs. For example, the relatively steep urves corresponding to CCBs suggest they may be the most sensi- ive to the various credit risk-related strategies. We finally consider one of the possible scenarios by partitioning he preferences in a particular fashion, i.e. w econ = w risk = 50%, and ummarize the results in Fig. 5 . While the economic performance f both the JSCBs and CCBs has worsened over time at an aver- ge annual rate of 1.17% and 1.72%, respectively, the SOCBs ineffi- iency has declined at 2.01% per year, suggesting the crisis might ave had a bigger impact on the JSCBs and CCBs compared to the tate-owned banks. This result is hardly surprising, considering the tatus of the SOCBs as relatively mature financial institutions play- ng a leading role in the Chinese banking industry, and may be ttributed to the effectiveness of the reforms implemented in the hinese banking sector since 2003, such as the changes in the hareholding system ( Dong, Firth, Hou, & Yang, 2016; Jiang, Yao, Feng, 2013; Zhu, Wu, Wang, & Yu, 2019 ). As far as the risk performance is concerned, the three types f banks appear to be catching up with one another as the risk nefficiency scores are changing at the average annual rate of 1.73%, 1.93%, and 5.34% for the SOCBs, JSCBs, and CCBs, espectively. These improvements are very much in line with the verall progress in the performance of banks cited in a number J.-P. Boussemart, H. Leleu and Z. Shen et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 277 (2019) 719726 725 o W e i t t r t i C i i C c 4 m h w r g a fi b d i w S b b s o e r c t e O t m v m a a r t i o i b e l a r e a c w s s o i o b l o A D s t S k F s 1 d S A R A A A A B B B B B B B B B B C C f recent studies of the Chinese banking sector ( Matthews, 2013; ang, Huang, Wu, & Liu, 2014; Zhu et al., 2019 ). Upon closer xamination, we can see the largest drop in credit risk inefficiency n the post-crisis era has occurred among the CCBs  assuming he two types of performance are weighted equally  suggesting he regulatory measures put in place to tackle exposure to credit isk might have benefited these institutions the most. Looking at he bottom two graphs, we also note the relatively high volatility n the performance of the JSCBs and CCBs, also reported by Zhang, ai, Dickinson, and Kutan (2016) and Zhu et al. (2019) , which mplies these banks could continue benefiting from the policies mplemented by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory ommission aimed at further stabilizing the performance of the ountrys financial sector. . Conclusion and directions for the future The notion of risk control plays a key role in banking. Its mis- anagement by some of the worlds largest financial institutions as led to a global financial crisis that started ten years ago, but hose consequences are still felt today. However, modeling credit isk efficiency in the same way as pollution-generating technolo- ies, which assumes a positive association between the intended nd unintended outputs at the frontier of technology, could be dif- cult to justify in the case of banking. We depart from this approach by introducing a different model ased on two sub-technologies. Loans are considered an interme- iate output in the first sub-technology before being decomposed nto good and non-performing loans in the second sub-technology, here the former are maximized and the latter are minimized. uch approach allows us to define and simultaneously measure oth credit risk inefficiency and the economic performance of anks. We provide an empirical illustration of our model using a ample of 30 Chinese banks from 2005 to 2012 and consider vari- us strategies banks may pursue to distinguish between the differ- nt policy objectives corresponding to economic performance and isk. Our results indicate that banks can increase their total in- ome at an average rate of 16% while simultaneously decreasing heir non-performing loans at an average rate of 33% when pref- rences for economic and risk performance are weighted equally. ur model can accommodate alternative weighing schemes for hese preferences, presenting researchers with more flexibility in odelling the constantly evolving economic (e.g. the continued de- elopment of Chinas economy) and financial (e.g. the establish- ent of financial risk-monitoring system) conditions. Bank man- gers may find it useful to take advantage of this flexibility when ttempting to strike a balance between economic performance and isk as they try to meet their profitability targets. Another key akeaway from our study is the relatively low estimated credit risk nefficiency of the state-owned banks, which we observe regardless f their relatively high stock of problem assets before, during and mmediately following the crisis. We surmise this could possibly e due to directives to meet the demand for funds from borrow- rs with different levels of credit risk appetite, which these banks ikely receive from the government. Finally, we find the economic nd credit risk inefficiency appear to be moving in the opposite di- ections most of the time. Our results suggest improving credit risk fficiency has required a simultaneous rise in economic inefficiency mong the joint-stock commercial banks and the city commer- ial banks, underlying the importance of recognizing this trade-off hen measuring the performance of financial institutions. We conclude by suggesting that future effort s devoted to the imultaneous measurement of economic and credit inefficiency hould account for the additional proxies for credit, market, and/or perational risk inherent to banking, which we were unable to nclude in the present study due to data limitations. Also, the idea f approximating a production process using two technologies can e further extended by including additional sub-technologies, al- owing researchers to better tailor their models to the specificities f unconventional production processes. cknowledgments The authors would like to thank the editor Robert Graham yson and the four referees whose useful suggestions helped ignificantly improve the paper.
