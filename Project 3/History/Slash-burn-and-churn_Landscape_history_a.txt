Because these occurrences coincide with the onset of human colonisation of the region, students of Amazonia discuss the extent to which its Holocene fire record reflects climatically-related and/or anthropogenic causes. One factor that complicates inferences is the overall heterogeneity of the basins vegetation: during drier moments of the Holocene and/or within less humid sub-regions of the basin, it is difficult to conclude whether fire signals reflect more frequent natural fires or more intense burning by human communities. Another factor is that pre-Columbian livelihoods were not homogenously distributed throughout the region and changed over the course of the Holocene. This paper seeks to help establish an anthropogenic baseline against which Holocene evidence for burning can be assessed. To this end, it reviews the role that slash-and-burn cultivation has had in discussions about pre-Columbian Amazonia, discusses how this account has been modified by recent research on pre-Columbian anthropogenic soils, and queries the extent to which the regionally-heterogeneous timing of crop domestication and cultivation may have influenced the fire history of pre-Columbian Amazonia.  2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Introduction Stephen Pyne (1998) illustrates fire regimes as two-cycle engines that oscillate between wet and dry conditions: in order for fires to start, the spark of lightning must take place and conditions must be dry. In the Amazon basin, home to the planets largest rainforest, lightning is by no means a rare occurrence. The combustibility of plant biomass, however, depends on the pre- vailing type of vegetation, which in turn is conditioned by year- round precipitation, the actual length of the dry season, and soil fertility: dense aseasonal rainforests are associated with high precipitation and well-drained clayey soils; open rainforests grow on soils with low water tables, poor drainage and/or drier condi- tions; semi-deciduous or seasonally dry rainforests grow in drier regimes with fertile soils or in areas of transition to savannah vegetation; and savannahs, which vary from sedge- and/or grass- dominated treeless landscapes to open parkland with patches of woodland, prevail in regions with poor soils and low overall precipitation (Piperno and Pearsall, 1998; Walsh, 1998; Daly and Mitchell, 2000; Mayle and Power, 2008). While all such formations may have above-threshold spark potential, the dura- tion of their wet and dry is different (Fig. 1): regions with thick rainforest, high rainfall, and unmarked seasonality should theo- retically experience infrequent burning; regions with semi- deciduous or seasonally dry forest, as well as areas dominated by savannah vegetation, should experience more frequent natural fires. Theoretical expectations aside, research dating soil charcoal near San Carlos de Rio Negro, one of the most humid regions of the Amazon basin (Fig. 1.v), documents the occurrence of forest fires in pre-Columbian times (Sanford et al., 1985; Saldarriaga and West, 1986; Saldarriaga, 1994). Ethnographic research from neighbour- ing areas show that vegetation clearance through burning e typi- cally as part of slash-and-burn cultivation e is possible during the driest months of the year (Hugh-Jones, 1979; Hill and Moran, 1983; Saldarriaga et al., 1988; Moran, 1991; van der Hammen, 1992). Considering the fact that archaeological evidence for the human occupation of Amazonia appears to span the entire Holocene (Miller, 1992a, 1999; Kipnis et al., 2005; Neves, 2008; Arroyo-Kalin, 2010), and that evidence for plant cultivation in northern South America is ancient (Piperno and Pearsall, 1998; Piperno, 2009a,b; see also; Clement et al., 2010), it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that humans may have set off forest fires even in these very humidE-mail address: m.arroyo-kalin@ucl.ac.uk.

It is thus unsurprising that students of Amazonia are increasingly paying more attention to possible evidence of pre- Columbian anthropogenic burning (e.g. Piperno, 1990; Herrera et al., 1992; Piperno and Becker, 1996; Athens and Ward, 1999; Behling et al., 1999; Bush et al., 2000, 2007a, 2008; Mora, 2003a; Heckenberger et al., 2007; Dull et al., 2010). Assessing the empirical evidence for past forest fires demands some sense of how the vegetation of the Amazon basin has changed over time. Palaeoecologists argue that the extent and composition of Amazonias forests have undergone significant changes since at least the late Pleistocene (Mayle et al., 2000; Mayle, 2004; Mayle et al., 2004): between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 19 cal ka BP) and the onset of the Holocene (ca. 11 cal ka BP) a non- analogous forest inwhich cloud forest-adapted Podocarpus sp. trees persisted until c. 9e8 cal ka BP (Absy et al., 1991; Sifeddine et al., 1994; Behling et al., 1999; Haberle and Maslin, 1999; Behling, 2001; Burbridge et al., 2004; Bush et al., 2004; De Oliveira, 2005) is thought to have expanded from the more humid sub-regions of the basin (van der Hammen and Hooghiemstra, 2000; Anhuf et al., 2006). This formation appears to have overtaken more open vegetation of drier sub-regions (Mayle and Beerling, 2004) and, already by the early Holocene, shaped much of the extent of rain- forest vegetation that is observed today (Irion et al., 2006; Bush et al., 2007a). However, spells of drier conditions, which may have reached their maximum intensity during the mid Holocene (Soubies, 1979e80; Absy et al., 1991; Sifeddine et al., 2001; Bush et al., 2007b; Mayle and Power, 2008), also appear to have driven vegetation in peripheral areas of the basine especially the ecotones of its southern rim e to become more dominated by dry-adapted forest and/or savannah. By the late Holocene, as increased austral summer insolation accentuated the strength of summer precipi- tation in South America, more humid conditions prevailed, in turn leading forests to expand once again (Mayle et al., 2000; Freitas et al., 2001; Pessenda et al., 2001; Mayle et al., 2007). Palaeoecological evidence for burning in Amazonia consists of microscopic charcoal recorded in pollen cores and/or charcoal fragments collected from exposed soil profiles. Burning begins to be recorded in the terminal Pleistocene although signals are scant and infrequent (Burbridge et al., 2004; Bush et al., 2004). Fire signals become more common in the early Holocene (Behling, 1996, 2001), i.e. in the same time range as the earliest evidence of human occupation of the basin (Roosevelt et al., 2002; Mora, 2003b). After the early Holocene the overall trend is an increased frequency of fires (Power et al., 2008), albeit with some interesting regional variation (Fig. 2): many of the palaeoecological records from regions with longer dry seasons show high fire frequencies during the mid Holocene (Mayle and Power, 2008); some pollen records from more humid regions (e.g. Pantano de Monica, Behling et al., Fig. 1. Map of the Amazon basin. Red squares, yellow diamonds and brown circles mark the location of, respectively, pollen records, soil charcoal studies, and archaeological sites referenced in the paper (see Table 1).

Arroyo-Kalin / Quaternary International 249 (2012) 4e18 5 Author's personal copy 1999; see also Guyanese soil charcoal, Charles-Dominique et al., 1998; Francis and Knowles, 2001; Hammond et al., 2007) lack clear evidence of mid Holocene burning while yet others from humid regions show interesting fire histories (e.g. Ayauchi, Piperno, 1990; Maxus core, Athens and Ward, 1999; Power et al., 2008). Overall, the frequency of fires suggested by burning evidence increases throughout the basin towards the late Holocene, reaching an apparent peak from approximately the 5th to the 16th century AD (Bush et al., 2007a; Power et al., 2008; Dull et al., 2010). This peak is consistent with the presence of archaeological remains of large sedentary, and intensive human settlement in rainforest-clad regions of the basin, mostly dated to the last millennium before European colonisation (Hilbert, 1968; Lathrap, 1970; Eden et al., 1984; Heckenberger et al., 1999, 2007; Roosevelt, 1999a, 2002; Bush and Silman, 2007; Neves, 2007; Arroyo-Kalin, 2008a). Human fires are easier to set off e and therefore more likely to be recorded in palaeoecological records e in dry conditions. However, under dry conditions natural fires are also more prone to occur, such that burning evidence is difficult to discriminate as anthropogenic (Bush et al., 2008; Mayle and Power, 2008). In humid regions, on the other hand, evidence for burning at first glance appears easier to link to anthropogenic causes. Notwith- standing, it is possible that the Holocene was characterised by short, ENSO-related periods of drier conditions e effectively acting as windows of opportunity for burning e and this complicates interpretations. (Sandweiss et al., 2001; Moy et al., 2002; Marengo et al., 2008). Cleary, in short, it is inherently difficult to conclusively associate palaeoecological burning evidence from the Holocene to anthropogenic causes. Some may feel that drawing a distinction between anthropo- genic and natural fires is a red herring. However, understanding better the anthropogenic dimension of past fires is a goal worthy of pursuing: reconstructing the basin's human fire history is evidently crucial to assess the extent and time-depth of humanmanipulation of the region's biodiversity (Bale, 2006, 2010; Bush and Silman, 2007). One approach to the matter is to strive for tighter integra- tion between palaeoecological and archaeological evidence (e.g. Bush et al., 1989, 2007a; Piperno, 1990). Another, one which this paper adopts, is to examine in sharper detail the fire potential of different past livelihoods. This is equivalent to establishing an anthropogenic baseline against which Holocene evidence for burning can be assessed. With this aim in mind, therefore, this paper seeks to reviews the role of slash-and-burn cultivation in discussions about pre-Columbian Amazonia, discuss how recent research on pre-Columbian anthropogenic soils invites modifica- tion of this account, and examine how the regionally- heterogeneous timing of crop domestication (and hence the inception of specific cultivation practices) may have influenced the fire history of pre-Columbian Amazonia. 2. Pre-Columbian slash-and-burn cultivation Burning of forest vegetation to create and maintain gardens, the latter generally between 0.5 and 2 ha in size, is widely reported in the ethnographic record of Amazonia. Once derided as a primitive form of agriculture, many specialists regard this practice as part of a sophisticated technique to manipulate the nutrient cycle of rain- forest vegetation: cutting and burning e slash-and-burn e miner- alises the nutrients of the standing plant biomass and amends the generally thin and nutrient-poor topsoil on which much forest vegetation grows. The soil thus amended, with a temporarily higher pH and added plant-available nutrients, allows for year-long crop- ping over periods of 1e3 years before fertility begins to once again decrease. After this, land can be left to fallow for short periods and secondary re-growth can subsequently be burned to re-mineralise nutrients once or twice. However, an ever-decreasing pool of nutrients eventually permits pioneer species to out-compete crops and, at this point, cultivation is abandoned in favour of longer e often decadal e periods of fallow. These fallow periods allow re- growth of thick primary vegetation (which, at some point, can again be felled and torched) and, over the mid- to long-term, produce a spatially-extensive rather than spatially-intensive farming pattern. Landscapes modified by slash-and-burn, however, are not automatically abandoned: in many instances tree crops (which continue to yield beyond the cycle of fast maturing crops and, in point of fact, beyond the decline in garden productivity due to nutrient loss) continue to be managed in fallow land. This leads to the formation of mosaics of vegetation at different stages of sucession. Studies show that some such landscapes can record histories of anthropogenic disturbance of bicentennial time-depth (Meggers and Evans, 1957; Harris, 1971; Carneiro, 1983; Hill and Moran, 1983; Beckerman, 1987; Denevan and Paddoch, 1987; Saldarriaga et al., 1988; Bale, 1989; Moran, 1991; van der Hammen, 1992; Saldarriaga, 1994; Piperno and Pearsall, 1998; Bale, 2006). Slash-and-burn cultivation has occupied an important position in archaeological discussions about pre-Columbian Amazonia. In a debate spanning over fifty years of scholarship, Betty Meggers (Meggers and Evans, 1957; Meggers, 1971, 1995, 1997) followed Julian Steward (1948a) in suggesting that slash-and-burn was an adaptation of late Holocene immigrating agriculturalists who encountered adverse conditions as they moved into Amazonia. She emphasised that high labour demands associated with felling trees to make gardens, coupled with the low nutrient status of Table 1 Data sources for Figs. 1 and 2.

M. Arroyo-Kalin / Quaternary International 249 (2012) 4e18 7 Author's personal copy Amazonian soils, had imposed stringent limitations to population growth and livelihoods demanding the frequent relocation of communities. In contrast, Lathrap and his colleagues (Lathrap,1970, 1977; Myers, 1974; Brochado, 1980; Oliver, 2001) argued that practices of slash-and-burn had originated in the extension of Amazonian house gardens. They were more enthusiastic about the productive potential of slash-and-burn cultivation yet ultimately envisioned an era of agricultural intensification based on cultiva- tion of nutrient-rich floodplain soils. Projecting back from ethno- graphic observations in the upper Xingu River, Carneiro (1961, 1983) pointed out that pre-Columbian slash-and-burn cultivation would not have been limited by soil fertility but, instead, by the increasingly more labour-intensive need to handle weed growth (see also Oliver, 2001, 2008). Denevan (1992b; 2001), in turn, offered another intriguing projection: that the extensive and long- fallow pattern characteristic of ethnographic slash-and-burn ought to be regarded as an artefact of the European introduction of metal tools. In his account, pre-Columbian cultivation would have been more intensive, more based on short fallow periods, more fire- reliant, and more labour-demanding. Some of these perspectives have been incorporated into more recent archaeological accounts of the Amazon rainforest. Roosevelt (1989, 1993; 1999a; 1999b) and Oliver, (2001) have followed the overall gist of Lathraps suggestion e that tropical forest cultures (slash-and-burn cultivators) would have been the norm in Ama- zonia before agricultural intensification in the late Holocene. Researchers in some regions of the Brazilian Amazon have been hesitant about the actual potential, let alone spatial extent of pre- Columbian agriculture (Miller,1992a,1999). In contrast, researchers in Colombia (Andrade, 1986, 1988; Mora, 1991; Herrera et al., 1992) and Ecuador (e.g. Bush and Colinvaux, 1988; Piperno, 1990; Athens and Ward, 1999) have discussed clearance and cultivation on the basis of anthropogenic soils, plant microfossils and charcoal evidence. More recently, Neves and Petersen (2006) have mar- shalled Denevans suggestion that pre-metal gardening would have demanded high labour to interpret long-term disturbance of Fig. 3.

All along, Lathrap's (1970) model of intensive floodplain cultivation remains archaeologically untested: even if it can be invoked on the basis of ethnographic observations (e.g. Hiraoka, 1989; Fraser, 2010), the presence of archaeological evidence of large settlements that are not associated with large floodplains (e.g. Heckenberger et al., 1999) clearly undermines its overall significance. 3. Anthrosols, soil churning, and fire Crucial evidence to discuss the overall importance of slash-and- burn cultivation during pre-Columbian times comes from studies of Amazonian Dark Earths (Sombroek, 1966; Smith, 1980; Lehmann et al., 2003; Glaser and Woods, 2004; Woods et al., 2008). These are soils also known as ADEs or as terras pretas de ndio. ADEs are anthropogenic soils of pre-Columbian origin that have been known to Amazonian scholars since the very onset of modern naturalist investigations (Smith, 1879; Hartt, 1885; Katzer, 1944; Gourou, 1949; Nimuendaj, 1949; Neves, 2004). Their neglect in tradi- tional archaeological accounts of the Amazon basin has strongly distorted understandings of the regions pre-Columbian history (Arroyo-Kalin, 2008a). ADEs are generally associated with late Holocene archaeological evidence, generally dating to the first or second millennium AD (Eden et al., 1984; Arroyo-Kalin, 2008a). Reported expanses extend over areas ranging between <1 and 80 ha and generally show a much higher agricultural aptitude than unmodified soils. In the 1960s pedologist Wim Sombroek (1966) hypothesised that terras pretas were the result of soil enrichment due to the decomposition of village refuse. With some amendments (Smith, 1980; Glaser et al., 1998; Lima et al., 2002; Arroyo-Kalin et al., 2008b), this interpretation has withstood the passage of time. Sombroek also noticed that larger expanses of less-enriched anthrosols, which he labelled terras mulatas, surrounded or were adjacent to terras pre- tas. He hypothesised that these areas recorded the effects of burning associated with past agricultural practices. Archaeologists and geographers in the Colombian (Andrade, 1986, 1988; Mora, 1991; Herrera et al., 1992) and Brazilian Amazon (Woods, 1995, 2002; McCann et al., 2001, 2003) identified and measured the chemical properties of similar anthrosols and variously argued for wide-area clearance, intensive cultivation, and/or crop intensifica- tion in pre-Columbian times. A study by the author of this paper (Arroyo-Kalin, 2008a,b; Arroyo-Kalin, 2010) has recently expanded existing knowledge about terras pretas and terras mulatas. Focusing on anthrosols associated with ceramists archaeological remains studied by the Central Amazon Project (Neves, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008), which are generally dated from the late first millennium BC to the second millennium AD (Donatti, 2003; Machado, 2005; Lima et al., 2006; Moraes, 2006), the study confirms previous observations that a gradient from higher to lower pH, organic carbon, and soil nutrients occurs along the terra preta> terra mulata>Oxisol catena (Fig. 3). In addition, it shows that in terras pretas these values (and very high magnetic susceptibility) are associated with high densi- ties of sand- to silt-sized fragments of charcoal, pottery, rubified clay, and bone (Fig. 4a, b, c). These kinds of debris point to the concentration of soot in the interior of dwelling structures (Arroyo- Kalin, 2008a) as well as the contributions of debris and burning Fig. 4.

Arroyo-Kalin / Quaternary International 249 (2012) 4e18 9 Author's personal copy from both low-temperature fires (associated with waste manage- ment, cooking and fish smoking) and high-temperature fires (associated with ceramic firing). The best model for the build-up of these soils appears to be anthropogenic sedimentation (Fig. 4d) coupled with mixing by soil fauna (Woods, 1995; Vacher et al., 1998; Kern et al., 2004; Arroyo-Kalin et al., 2007; Arroyo-Kalin, 2008b). Some controversy has existed about the extent to which terra preta sites reflect long-lasting, continued inhabitation as opposed to overlapping short-lived occupations (Meggers, 2001; Neves et al., 2003, 2004; Heckenberger et al., 2003a). Archaeologists directly involved in their excavation moreover, have cogently argued that mounds at some archaeological sites recycle soils containing ceramic shards and charcoal from previous occupations (Neves, 2003; Machado, 2005; Moraes, 2006). Thus the possibility exists that large occupations detected on the basis of archaeological remains actually postdate the formation of anthropogenic soils themselves. To examine these questions, the study concentrated and dated the microscopic charcoal pool of samples from terras pretas (Fig. 5). Resulting ages on microscopic charcoal are consis- tent with ages from radiocarbon dates of macroscopic charcoal and pottery remains embedded in the soil, suggesting that the pyro- genic carbon pool of terras pretas is coeval with the most intense human occupations inferred from archaeological evidence. The reported study also found intriguing differences between terras pretas and terras mulatas. The latter are anthropogenically- enriched soils (Fig. 3eeh) whose A horizon contain important but on the whole lower quantities of microscopic charcoal than terras pretas (Fig. 6a, b) as well as negligible fragments of microscopic bone, pottery, or burnt clay (Fig. 6a, b). Studied samples from the A horizon show high magnetic susceptibility compared to samples from a sub-recently fired Oxisol A horizon, suggesting that soil iron has been altered by intensive near-surface burning (Fig. 7).

A sample from the A2 horizon (S1, WK-16222, 2269  42 14C BP), representing charcoal in soil material used to build the mound, falls within the error bars of old (pre-terra preta) charcoal collected under Mound I.

Arroyo-Kalin / Quaternary International 249 (2012) 4e1810 Author's personal copy Micromorphological observations also show a clear truncation between the lower part of awell-preserved buried A horizon and its underlying B horizons (Fig. 6c, d), suggesting some form of scraping, raking, or churning of the soil. The reported research not only questions the scenario of short, repeated occupations advanced by some scholars (Meggers, 2001) but also offers an alternative to Lathraps model of agricultural intensification on fl floodplain soils. Its main observations suggest Sombroeks (1966) insights about terras pretas and terras mulatas are essentially correct: high concentrations of microscopic char- coal sequestered in expanses of anthropogenic soils beyond former settlements evidence that pre-Columbian slash-and-burn culti- vation, at least in the vicinity of Manaus (a region on the whole more humid than eastern and southern Amazonia but drier that western and northwest sub-regions of the basin), was spatially- concentrated, fire-intensive, and capable of achieving a lasting enhancement of soil fertility. This inference endorses Denevans (2004) suggestion that pre-Columbian swidden agriculture before European contact was less extensive and more reliant on permanent soil modification than observed ethnographically. It also suggests that Carneiros defence of swidden agriculture may actually underestimate the extent of modified anthrosols in the region (Oliver, 2008; Schmidt, 2010). In parallel, the reported research also cautions against over- simplifying data for the formation processes and presence/absence of these soils: ethnography-based studies (Zeidler, 1983; Hecht, 2003; Silva and Rebellato, 2004; WinklerPrins, 2006; Schmidt, 2010) suggest that the production and manipulation of soil inputs such as charcoal and ash are a common feature of village life in the Amazon basin, whilst archaeological studies show that charcoal- rich anthropogenic soils are not exclusive to the Amazon basin (e.g. Prous, 1991; Vacher et al., 1998; Oyuela-Caycedo and Bonzani, 2005; Castillo and Aceituno, 2006; Oliver, 2008). In other words, it is likely that the distribution of known Amazonian instances is skewed towards regions where archaeologists have paid attention to both larger archaeological sites and soil composition. Microscopic analysis of pre-Columbian anthropogenic soils, lastly, also highlights interesting avenues for future research. On the one hand, quantification of settlement-related microscopic charcoal by unit volume of soil could be used to develop a proxy for intensity of occupation, one that would almost certainly contradict suggestions that nomadic occupations produce more charcoal than sedentary ones (cf. Mora, 2003a). Quantification of off-settlement microscopic charcoal by unit volume of soil, in turn, could even- tually provide a proxy of agricultural intensification. These obser- vations hopefully will encourage palaeoecologists to seek, quantify and calibrate coeval burning signals in nearby pollen records instead of marshalling the sum total of archaeological and soil charcoal radiocarbon dates as a proxy of intensive burning (e.g. Bush and Silman, 2007, Fig. 3). 4. When did Amazonian slash-and-burn cultivation begin? Early Holocene human communities of the Amazon basin have generally been regarded as small, most likely nomadic populations with a forager subsistence focus. Yet, different sites along the basin (Miller, 1987; Magalhes, 1993, 1995; Roosevelt et al., 1996; Morcote-Ros and Bernal, 2001; Costa, 2002; Mora, 2003b) high- light that these foragers relied on the harvesting of fruit trees, a practice which often led to the discard and charring of seeds and nuts at frequently-revisited locales. At least two dynamics of landscape domestication (in the sense of Clement, 1999, 2006b), both with potential for spatially-restricted impact on vegetation, can be inferred from these remains. First, practices leading to the formation of anthropogenic patches of desirable fruit-bearing trees at frequently-revisited locales, similar to those reported ethno- graphically (Morcote et al., 1996, 1998; Politis, 1996; Politis, 1999; Crdenas and Politis, 2000; Clement, 2006a), most likely encour- aged repeated burning at itinerantly-visited campsites. Second, considering that the oldest archaeobotanical evidence of crops in Amazonia e at Pea Roja e is associated with these finds (Fig. 1.4, Piperno and Pearsall, 1998; Mora, 2003b), and envisioning how repeated deposition of charcoal would lead to incipient enhance- ment of soils (Arroyo-Kalin, 2010), it is not far-fetched to argue that Amazonian gardening practices may actually date back to the early Holocene (see also Piperno, 2009b). Livelihoods so characterised, however, fall one step short of slash-and-burn cultivation: rather than being characterised by a continuous regime of felling and firing vegetation to open land for cultivation, they are likely to have resembled house gardens and forest gardens, or - in the more humid regions of the basin - perhaps approached practices of slash- and-mulch (Lathrap, 1977; Rival, 1998, 2002; Lu, 1999). In point of fact, the antiquity of slash-and-burn cultivation in the Amazon basin continues to elude researchers: it can be expected but not established on the basis of other early northern South American evidence (Piperno, 2009b); it can be surmised but not ascertained from palaeoecological evidence for burning and disturbance (Athens and Ward, 1999; Bush et al., 2007b). One way to address the matter is to consider more specifically why people in Amazonia engage in slash-and-burn cultivation. Here it is worth pointing out a significant characteristic of Amazonian gardens managed through slash-and-burn: though often noted for their high agro-biodiversity (Harris, 1971; Beckerman, 1987; Oliver, 2001), the vast majority of Amazonian cases focus on the Fig. 7. Magnetic susceptibility values (Y  depth, X  Low frequency Tesla units, measured with a dual frequency Bartington MS2/MS2B sensor) from four profiles. (a) Hatahara site, terra preta profile; (b) Lago Grande, buried terra mulata profile; (c) Lago Grande, exposed terra mulata profile; (d) control profile on same landform as Hatahara site, with sub-recent burning. All four soil profiles are texturally clayey. M. Arroyo-Kalin / Quaternary International 249 (2012) 4e18 11 Author's personal copy intercropping of maize and sweet manioc (e.g. Steward, 1948b; Descola, 1994; Salick et al., 1997), or on the cultivation of bitter manioc (Goldman, 1963; Chernela, 1987; McKey and Beckerman, 1993; Emperaire, 2002; Fraser and Clement, 2008). If cultivation of these crops constitutes the prime reason to slash-and-burn in Amazonia, attention to their specific local histories provides one way to examine the antiquity of associated cultivation practices in the region. Maize was domesticated in Central America (Piperno and Flannery, 2001; Pope et al., 2001) and trickled into northern South America (Bray et al., 1987; Piperno and Holst, 1998; Pearsall, 2003; Piperno, 2006b) as early as the 8th millennium BP. The oldest Amazonian evidence dates to at least 5.3e5.0 cal ky BP at the Ayauchi pollen core, located in the Ecuadorian montaa (Fig. 1.E, Piperno, 1990), a humid region in which other fire and/or vegeta- tion disturbance signals (Piperno, 1990; Athens and Ward, 1999; Weng et al., 2002) and occupations by ceramists dated between the 5th to 3rd millennium BP (Fig. 1.1 and 2, Valdez et al., 2005; Rostain, submitted for publication) are recorded. Maize pollen and phytoliths older than 5.5e5.3 cal ky BP are also recorded in sediments at the Abeja site, Colombian Amazon (Fig. 1.4, Mora, 1991; Herrera et al., 1992; Piperno and Holst, 1998), with an unclear association with archaeological artefacts (Mora et al., 1988:ff). Maize is also reported in segments of pollen cores dating to c. 3.6e3.7 cal ky BP in both the lower Amazon region and the Puerto Maldonado region (Fig. 1c, g,; Bush et al., 2008), findings that are broadly coeval with regional archaeological evidence for small groups of terra firme ceramists (lower Amazon and Maraj: Fig. 1.20,21,22,24, Simes, 1969; Roosevelt, 2000; Gomes, 2008; Peruvian Amazon: Fig. 1.3, Allen, 1968). When evidence for maize cultivation is considered, palae- oecological and archaeological data show a suggestive temporal gradient that starts outside Amazonia and reaches both the lower Amazon region and Peruvian Amazonia by the beginning of the 4th millennium BP. It is tempting to suggest that this gradient also describes the adoption of slash-and-burn cultivation practices in the basin. However, it should be remembered that maize is readily out-competed by forest vegetation: it generally grows well inter- cropped with other cultivars in open plots, on floodplain soils associated with whitewater rivers, and e to judge from plant microfossil evidence (Herrera et al., 1992; Bozarth et al., 2008)e on pre-Columbian anthropogenic soils. The scant available 13C isotope data on human bone for the fourth millennium BP (from the vicinity of Santarm) does not suggest a dominant intake of C4 plants in the diet (see Roosevelt, 1989; Roosevelt, 2000). This may well indicate that the cultivation of maize in places without access to rich floodplain soils or anthropogenic soils may have been difficult in the past. This point is buttressed by the fact that 13C data from human bones associated with the formation of late first millennium AD (Neves, 2003) terras pretas do not suggest a diet dominated by C4 plants either (Arroyo-Kalin, 2010). The other key crop of Amazonian slash-and-burn cultivation is manioc (Manihot esculenta ssp. esculenta Crantz). Many scholars underscore manioc as the Amazonian staple crop because of its high starch yield, well-documented ability to grow on acid soils, and capability of keeping its tubers un-harvested for over 12 months e a trait which has been described as underground storage (Carneiro, 1983; Heckenberger, 1998; Piperno and Pearsall, 1998). As hinted above, cultivated manioc in reality consists of two broad varieties e bitter and sweet manioc. The former is the main crop used in slash-and-burn cultivation in Orinoquia and the Guianas, as well as in much of the northwest, eastern and south-eastern regions of the Amazon basin: it is high starch- yielding, well-adapted to acid soils and pests, but has high concentrations of cyanogenic glucosides that require detoxification before human consumption. In contrast, sweet manioc is more common in the western and south-western regions of the Amazon basin, as well as in regions beyond the basin: it requires no prior detoxification, but is a low starch yielder that is intolerant to poor soils or pests (Fig. 8). As a result, it is generally cultivated in amended soils near dwellings and/or intercropped with maize (Denevan, 1971; Carneiro, 1983; Boster, 1984; Beckerman, 1987; Chernela, 1987; Dufour, 1989, 1995; Emperaire, 2001; Emperaire, 2002; Wilson and Dufour, 2002). The phylogenetic split between bitter and sweet manioc varieties is ancient and took place after initial domestication (Mhlen et al., 2000; Elias et al., 2004; McKey et al., 2010). Microfossils of M. esculenta, Manihot sp. and Manihot-types are reported outside the Amazon basin as early as 10.3e9.9 and 8.5e8.3 cal ky BP (Piperno and Holst, 1998; Piperno et al., 2000; Aceituno and Castillo, 2005). However, by far the best- documented evidence are microscopic starch grains associated with lithic artefacts of preceramic occupations in Panama dating to 6th millennium BP (Piperno, 2006a). The oldest Amazonian evidence is limited to veritable amounts of pollen found in the 5.5e5.3 to 5.0e4.9 cal ky BP Tubabonipa component of the Abeja site, in northwest Amazonia (Fig. 1.4, Mora, 1991; Piperno and Pearsall, 1998). This evidence appears to mimic the north-to- south gradient of maize cultivation, which might suggest that manioc originated outside the Amazon basin. However, genetic evidence demonstrates that manioc is an Amazonian domesticate: populations of M. esculenta ssp. flabellifolia in southwest Amazonia are ancestral to all forms of cultivated manioc (Olsen and Schaal, 1999). Southwest Amazonia more than fits the part for a source region of cultivated manioc: palaeoecological data suggests an early-mid Holocene landscape characterised by more open, drier and fire-prone vegetation (Fig. 1.vi, Freitas et al., 2001)e conditions ideal for the domestication of a disturbance-adapted species with underground storage organs capable of withstanding prolonged drought and which, on the whole, is fire-friendly (McKey and Beckerman, 1993; Pujol et al., 2002). The archaeological record, in turn, shows human occupations from the Late Pleistocene onwards and, significantly, includes the oldest clearly-reported examples of anthropogenic soils in the Amazon basin, c. 5.0 cal ky BP preceramic dark earths associated with terra firme occupations of the Mas- sangana phase (Fig. 1.19, Miller, 1992a; b; Miller, 1999, 2009). Considering the fact that sweet rather than bitter manioc is cultivated in southwest Amazonia, it is not far fetched to suggest that early anthropogenic soils of southwest Amazonia played a role in the domestication of cultivated manioc. As suggested elsewhere (Arroyo-Kalin, 2010), dump heaps would have helped to cultivate away from parent populations those individuals selected for their low toxicity, such that the low starch-yielding, less pest-resistant, sweet manioc varieties would have evolved. Pest-resistant but toxic bitter varieties, well-adapted to poor soils, would have evolved later, their selection driven by their high starch yields and permitted by technological innovations that allowed both sustainable outfield cultivation and crop detoxification (see also McKey and Beckerman, 1993; McKey et al., 2010). From the point of view of the antiquity of slash-and-burn cultivation, the split between sweet and bitter manioc may epito- mise two contrasting Amazonian livelihoods (Fig. 8). One is the smaller-scale maize- and sweet manioc-dependent tropical forest culture pattern characteristic of western Amazonia: slash-and- burn cultivation that accords well with ethnographic accounts and can be expected to produce little overall impact on the land- scape. Another are the resilient livelihoods based on bitter manioc cultivation: these may have originated in a process of agricultural intensification that relied on the production of terras mulatas along the main rivers of the basin after the onset of the 1st millennium M. Arroyo-Kalin / Quaternary International 249 (2012) 4e1812 Author's personal copy AD. Burning associated with this livelihood may have had a signif- icant but localised impact on the overall landscape. Both patterns would have relied on the burning of vegetation for clearance but only the latter would be expected to produce a consistently high frequency burning signal in some pollen records: a result of intensive cultivation and practices of charring organicmatter in the large pre-Columbian settlements that today appear as expanses of terras pretas, and e in areas where burning vegetation extensively wasmore difficulte an outcome of outfield management practices that today appear as expanses of terras mulatas. 5. Discussion Holocene age archaeological evidence provides important pointers to suggest that spatial heterogeneity in the adoption of specific cultivation techniques e the latter associated with specific cultivars (sweet manioc and maize vis--vis bitter manioc) e could account for part of the regional variability of Amazonias fire history. For instance, the apparent paradox between the fact that some rainforest-clad, humid regions, e.g. the upper Negro and Manaus regions (Sanford et al., 1985; Saldarriaga, 1994; Piperno and Becker, 1996; Santos et al., 2000), show less evidence of fire and/or vegetation disturbance in the mid Holocene (even when evidence for human occupation is recorded, see Costa, 2002, 2009; Neves, 2008; Arroyo-Kalin, 2010), while other rainforest-clad humid regions, such as the Ecuadorian Amazon (Piperno, 1990; Athens and Ward, 1999; Weng et al., 2002) show clear fire signals could indicate that each region was characterised by different agricultural histories: maize cultivation (Bush et al., 1989; Piperno and Pearsall, 1998) appears to have expanded early but timidly into the humid reaches of western Amazonia, in parallel with early sub-Andean Formative activity (Valdez et al., 2005; Rostain, submitted for publication). It may have reached drier lowland regions, such as Puerto Maldonado (Bush et al., 2007b, 2008; McMichael et al., 2010) and the lower Amazon (Bush et al., 2008) by the fourth millennium BP, and be represented by Formative assemblages of the lowlands (Allen, 1968; Lathrap, 1970, 1971; Roosevelt, 2000). It might have gone in hand with cultivation of domesticatedmanioc, which had been selected in themore open or drier vegetation conditions of the early-mid Holocene in southwest Amazonia (Arroyo-Kalin, 2010). These occupations would have been characterised by the smaller-scale maize- and sweet manioc- dependent tropical forest culture pattern of western Amazonia, a pattern that would have produced tenuous, locally- discontinuous, and asynchronous fire signals. In contrast, along the main rivers of the Amazon basin, increased burning associated with intensive cultivation of bitter manioc and the formation of sedentary settlements, could be a result of population expansion along the dry-to-humid gradient of eastern, central, southwest and northwest Amazonia. This expansion, which later in time reached Fig. 8. Map of bitter and sweet manioc varieties compiled from ethnographic sources by Emperaire (Emperaire, 2001), modified with permission. Bar with red outline in the middle Madeira River region reflects dataset presented by Fraser et al. (2008). M. Arroyo-Kalin / Quaternary International 249 (2012) 4e18 13 Author's personal copy humid regions such as northwest Amazonia (where the highest agrodiversity of bitter manioc is recorded, see Emperaire, 2002), could explain the widespread formation of anthropogenic soils starting in the first millennium AD. Settlement and cultivation activities associatedwith these soils, mostly focused along themain rivers of the basin, may have driven the higher frequency of fires observed in palaeoecological records during the final millennia before European colonisation. However broad-stroked, this contrast between cultivation regimes illlustrates how assessing Amazonian evidence of past fires requires taking into consideration not only palaeoclimatic factors and the temporal and spatial variability of Holocene vegetation change, but also the temporal and spatial variability implicit in the basins history of food production systems. It cannot be over- emphasised how Amazonian agrarian systems changed over time (Arroyo-Kalin et al., 2008a; Arroyo-Kalin, 2010): arboriculture in the early-mid Holocene involved a transition from spatially- extensive harvesting to more spatially-intensive tending and cultivation that set out the foundation of so-called fallow management. Associated burning at habitation sites and evidence for soil enrichment links the earliest indications of enduring landscape modification with the most ancient evidence for allochthonous crop cultivation. Cultivation of allochthonous maize and domestication of autochthonous sweetmanioce both of which are susceptible to pests and require nutrient-enhanced soils to grow e most likely developed in dump heaps/house gardens associated with small-scale early-mid Holocene tropical forest cultures. Selection for bitter manioc may have taken place in more open/drier regions, its subsequent use in rainforest environments coming to rely on the ability to produce micro-environmental replicas of savannah conditions with artificially-enhanced soils through intensive slash-and-burn cultivation. The end-result of this agricultural history e which might be labelled slash-burn-and- churn e strongly contrasts with post-European swidden cultiva- tion (Denevan, 2004). 6. Conclusion Deforestation of theworlds largest andmost complex rainforest biome advances at an unprecedented rate (Fearnside, 2005). Unabated, it will continue to impact negatively the array of native, peasant, and urban societies that inhabit the Amazon basin today. It will also endanger one of the worlds most biologically-diverse ecosystems ande if much of the forest eventually goese contribute significantly to global warming. Faced with the need to advocate alternative modes of rainforest use, and confronted by profit- seeking forces and energetic concerns that are at times thinly- disguised as development imperatives, it might appear tempting to fall back on tropes that portray Amazonia as a system in its natural state before the recent impact of industrial society. However, the growing body of evidence about anthropogenic landscape trans- formations in pre-Columbian Amazonia (papers in Bale, 2010; Junqueira et al., 2010) clearly rejects this pristine myth (Denevan, 1992a). In this connection, concerns have been raised about how insufficiently specific statements concerning the spatial extent of pre-Columbian landscape modifications could provide advocates of industrial farming/stock raising, forest extraction, and ore mining (and their traditional allies, power generation and infrastructure development) with a misleading yet rhetorically- powerful set of arguments: that Amazonia is some kind of over- grown woodland that has been left to fallow for five centuries (see discussion by Bush and Silman, 2007; Bush et al., 2008). Even if neither archaeological nor ethnohistorical sources suggest that pre- Columbian populations depleted local resources or irreversibly deteriorated the landscape of Amazonia, these concerns are reasonable and call for researchers to ground-truth the ubiquity of evidence for anthropogenic modification before drawing conclu- sions about Amazonia as a whole. In the case of Amazonian Dark Earths, it is not overdue to reiterate that all known exemplars are actually archaeological sites. Consequently, the overall density of ADEs in the landscape reflects the superimposed distribution of past human occupations. The majority of well-documented cases appear to be located in the vicinity of natural concentrations of aquatic resources, an observation that underscores the well-known complementarity between fish and cultivated plants in Amazonia (Arroyo-Kalin, 2008a). It is worthy of future attention that these modified locales most likely exerted a pull factor or had an attractor dynamic among Amazonian societies, heralding growing population densities in specific places of Amazonia. Rather than minimising their impact, the evidence discussed in this paper suggests these human communities were cornerstones of both environmentally-transformative dynamics and sustainable liveli- hoods, indeed veritable stewards of actual Holocene biodiversity (Stahl, 1996).
