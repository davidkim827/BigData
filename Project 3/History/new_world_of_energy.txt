6 A new world of energy va c l a v sm i l By the 1750s a few small regions of Western Europe (most notably parts of England,Wales, Scotland, Belgium, and Germany) were in the early stages of energy transition from plant fuels to fossil fuels and from animate prime movers to machines powered by combustion. This remarkably rapid epochal shift created the modern world, which is marked by unprecedented magni- tudes and efficiencies of energy uses, enormous technical advances, rapid population and economic growth, and new social arrangements. Eventually the entire world was transformed by this grand transition, but until after the middle of the twentieth century surprisingly little was added to its progress outside North Atlantic Europe (where the process began) and the United States (where it reached new heights and maturity between 1870 and 1950). Great powers of the past that continued to rely on traditional energy sources and on animate prime movers were swiftly left far behind: although in aggregate terms China, with its large population, remained the worlds largest economy until the 1880s, in per capita terms its economic product had stagnated for many generations and by 1913 it was less than a tenth of the British rate, which had quadrupled in less than a century. Similarly, the US economy, whose aggregate size was only about a tenth of Indias value in 1820, was 2.5 times as large in 1913, and roughly eight times as rich in per capita terms. In fundamental energetic terms the path of all late modernizers was thus preordained: in all cases the subsequent economic development had to follow the new Euro-American pattern of energy uses. This first became evident in the case of two new economic and military rivals to the Atlantic dominance  imperial Japan (starting in the 1870s) and Soviet Russia (starting in the 1920s). Both of these had to base their quest for influence on copying, adopting, and adapting Western techniques, resting on a mastery of new energy sources, such as coal, oil, and hydroenergy, and new energy con- verters, including internal combustion engines and electric motors and lights. 164 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Chinas epochal energy transition began only during the 1950s; it was marked initially by some tragic choices, including the Great Leap Forward and the ensuing famine of 19591961, and entered an accelerated stage only during the 1980s. Indias transition took off only during the 1990s. Historians have not ignored energy as a subject of their studies but it is undeniable that the production, transport, and conversion of fuels and electricity and multitudes of their final uses have been, at least in explicit terms, relatively neglected as a leading topic of modern historical inquiries. Of course, dealing with energy cannot be avoided. After all, as any physicist would point out, every action (from shining stars to marching armies) requires a conversion of one form of energy into another  and a thermo- dynamicist would add that all those conversions entail a loss of entropy, that is a decrease in energys utility: no energy ever gets lost but every conversion degrades its quality, so say the two most fundamental physical laws. So all historians are unwitting illustrators of the universal dictates of thermodynamic laws. In addition, although they rarely use the term power in their writings in its correct physical meaning, that is, as energy flow per unit of time (rather than as a common descriptor of might or military capacity), many historians have contributed detailed insights into the evolu- tion of prime movers (humans, draft animals, waterwheels, windmills, steam engines, internal combustion, rockets), energy sources (wood and charcoal, coal, oil and natural gas, thermal and hydroelectricity generation), and their uses. And the minority of historians dealing explicitly with the complex phenomena of energy has been joined by assorted interdisciplinarians con- tributing their knowledge and insight from other fields. Consequently, we have been fairly well served with many detailed histor- ical studies of particular energy sectors. The history of coal is particularly well covered, as is that of electricity generation and use. The evolution of prime movers ranging from horses and sailing ships to internal combustion engines has been well studied, as have the vehicles, ships, and airplanes these engines have powered. Measuring energy advances The breadth and quality of existing studies allows me not to recapitulate their findings, many of which provide fascinating but highly time- and place- specific details. Instead I will concentrate on just six universal measures, the A new world of energy 165 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

These are: energy density, power density, the maximum power of prime movers, the efficiency of energy conversions, the per capita con- sumption of useful energy, and, given the role of violent conflicts in history, the maximum energies of weapons. Before 1750 most of these indicators had either remained (quantitatively and qualitatively) entirely unchanged or had shown only very slow, hesitant, and uneven advances during the millennia of recorded history. As a result, in 1700 Chinese peasants plowing grain fields, Indian builders erecting tall structures, Turkish merchants trading with distant places, Italian messengers carrying urgent news, English laborers smelting metals, and Inca families cooking their meals relied overwhelmingly on the same energy sources (low- energy-density plant fuels) and on the same primemovers (their ownmuscles or the exertions of often inadequately fed domesticated animals) that their predecessors used one or two millennia earlier. There were some notable improvements but they took place very slowly: their use was largely restricted to only a few regions and did not amount to a fundamental qualitative change. By 1700 the best-built English waterwheels, whose origins go back to antiquity, became fairly efficient, as did (after nearly a millennium of evolution) the best windmill designs, but in many regions both devices did not greatly differ from their ancient prototypes. For exam- ple, simple Cretanwindmills with four to twelve triangular cloth sails were used around the Mediterranean in an unchanged form from medieval to modern times, while in other regions (most notably in parts of China and Japan) any mechanical prime movers were a rarity. By contrast to the unchanging, stagnating, or very slowly improving measures concerning the quality of energy sources and the performance of prime movers before 1750, the centuries after this brought great changes, introducing not only impressive quantitative gains but also fundamentally superior qualities. When seen from physical thermodynamic perspectives, the magnitude of those stunning, concatenated post-1750 changes can be traced by following the (rising or declining) trajectories of the fundamental measures and by comparing their outcomes at the end of the twentieth century with the performances that prevailed in the middle of the eighteenth century. Doing so requires, as energy studies invariably do, plenty of numbers, but I will deploy them in a user-friendly way, explaining the quantities and key assumptions in order to allow an interested reader to v a c l a v s m i l 166 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Energy density The first of my six universal measures is the fundamental matter of energy density, that is, the quantity of energy in a unit mass of matter: in modern scientific parlance this is joules (J) per gram (g) or (because both of those are such tiny units), megajoules (MJ) per kilogram (kg) or gigajoules (GJ) per tonne (t), and because both of those units go up three orders of magnitude in each step the number itself does not change. At a basic existential level, the importance of this variable is best grasped by comparing the energy densities of different types of food, because acquiring food determined much of the behavior of our species during the first 95 percent of its existence. Active lives of adult gatherers and hunters demanded easily more than 13 MJ of food energy a day. Getting them from leaves or stems (as many primates, includ- ing gorillas, do) would require eatingmore than 15 kg of such plant mass a day and spending most days just gathering that amount, leaving little time for evolving more intelligent existence. Getting that amount from fruits (as do chimpanzees, our closest primate relatives) would require finding 5 kg of them a day, an equivalent of more than thirty apples, sweet but with no fat and with only a low share of the protein needed for growth; not surprisingly, in their quest for protein chimpanzees also hunt colobus monkeys and fish for termites with blades of grass. And securing 13 MJ a day by foraging for nutritious underground biomass required digging 5 kg of tubers by hand or with simple digging sticks, and would still lead to deficiencies in protein and fat. And, obviously, fruits and tubers could be had in temperate and boreal regions only seasonally, restricting the extent of human habitation. In contrast, killing of megaherbivores (mammoth, bison, giant elk) pro- vided hundreds of kilograms of fatty meat and internal organs whose high energy density made it possible to survive in boreal environments. Eating just 1.52 kg of this food supplied not only all the needed energy but also plenty of the best-quality protein and fat. No wonder our ancestors were willing to take their chances by hunting animals whose body mass was ten or even fifty times greater than their own. These quests left them well fed and with enough free time to create admirable paintings of animals on the cave walls of Altamira, Lascaux, or Chauvet.

Although some fossil fuels were used millennia ago, such as outcropping coal in Han China and bitumen pools in ancient Mesopotamia, the only fuels used by most societies since antiquity were a few varieties of phytomass: wood (usually burned after a period of air- drying), charcoal derived from it, crop residues (mostly cereal straws), roots, leaves, and grasses. A few minor exceptions aside, since their emer- gence as a distinct species humans had thus lived only by tapping solar energy recently transformed into food and fuel, that is, by relying on almost instant flows (a financial equivalent would be to stay on a steady income) of renewable energy. Large-scale coal mining began the epochal switch of the energy basis of our society to living on ancient accumulations of solar flows, on products of photosynthesis transformed after millions of years of underground processing into carbonaceous fuels: we began to draw on a finite store of accumulated energy capital. Between 1750 and 1900 there was an exponential expansion of coal mining in Europe and the United States (as well as the beginning of modern coal industries in Russia, China, and India), and during the last decade of the nineteenth century the energy content of extracted coal had surpassed the aggregate energy content of phytomass fuels burned worldwide to generate household and industrial heat. And by that time coal was not the only fossil fuel that was extracted on a commercial scale: new industries tapping crude oil emerged in the United States, Russia, Burma, and Indonesia and the United States pioneered the use of natural gas. Comparison of energy densities of these fuels makes it clear why modern civilization is so funda- mentally different from its predecessors. All phytomass fuels are products of photosynthesis, with cellulose and lignin dominating their chemical composition and their energy density. As a result, their energy density is around 15 MJ per kg of air-dry matter. There was an option of using pyrolysis (slow heating in the absence of oxygen) to produce charcoal from wood (and sometimes from other biomass): every OldWorld civilization used it, from antiquity into the twentieth century. But while charcoal (a nearly pure carbon) has energy density of 29MJ/kg (nearly twice that of air-dry wood), its traditional production required at least five units of wood per unit of charcoal, resulting in 60 percent loss of initially charged energy and making charcoal much more expensive than wood and beyond the reach of most people. Anthracite, the best variety of coal, has pretty much the same high energy density as charcoal (2930 MJ/kg), and that is why its accessible reserves v a c l a v s m i l 168 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Most bituminous coals (used to generate electricity or to produce metallurgical coke) have densities 1.5 times that of air-dry wood (2223 MJ/kg), while a kilogram of refined oil products (be it gasoline, kerosene, or diesel fuel) packs about 42 MJ, nearly three times the energy density of air-dried wood. Moreover, crude oil (petroleum) and liquid fuels produced from it by the refining of crude oil (gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, heavy oil) are particularly convenient: easy to transport (by pipelines, ships, barges, trucks), easy to store (underground or in aboveground tanks), flexible to use (for any stationary application and for land, water, and air transport). As a result, economies relying on liquid fuels are far more efficient and flexible than those dependent on coal or wood. Many limits and possibilities of everyday options and historical developments can be explained by comparing energy densities: the more concentrated sources of energy offer many great advantages in terms of their extraction, transportation, and storage costs, flexibility of use and conversion options. An excellent historical example of economic (and hence social) constraints due to energy density concerns the efficiency of transatlantic crossings. For a single crossing in 1907, the ill-fated Lusitania (launched in that year as the biggest passenger ship ever and torpedoed by a German U-boat in May 1915) displacing 45,000 t, had to carry about 5,500 t of coal taking up 10,000 m3 of bunker space (assuming 23 GJ/t, 0.6 t/m3 of pulverized coal); if it were fueled by wood chips (15 GJ/t; 0.3 t/m3 of wood chips) its fuel load would have been more than 50 percent heavier and it would have taken up three times as much space  while an oil-fueled vessel of the same displacement would have needed only 3,000 t of fuel oil (42 GJ/t; 0.85 t/m3) in tanks taking up only a third of coal storages space. Actual mass and volume differences would be even larger because of higher combustion efficiencies of coal versus wood and, even more so, of oil versus coal; but even this simplified comparison makes it clear why there could never be affordable wood-fueled transatlantic crossings that would have transported more than 40 million European emigrants to North and South America, and why the shipping companies switched from coal to fuel oil as soon as the latter high-energy density liquid became reliably available: as with so many technical innovations, that switch was led by the military, as the British Navy, prodded by Winston Churchill, began converting its ships to oil just before the First World War.

The latter ratio has a number of meanings in different science and engineering disciplines, but I favor its use as a universal measure of energy flow (that is power) per unit of horizontal surface area (W/m2). The main advantage of this measure is its suitability for comparing virtually all natural or anthropogenic energy flows, and it is particularly revealing for highlighting the differences between traditional renewable energy flows (characterized by low to very low power densities) and modern fossil fuel uses (proceeding at medium to very high power densities). I will illustrate this by using two revealing examples. The first one demonstrates why mass-scale urbanization, a key attribute of moderni- zation, could not have been fueled by wood, even less so by charcoal, because those phytomass fuels have inherently low power density. The second one calculates the demand that the smelting of civilizations most important metal would have made on the worlds forests in the absence of coke made from metallurgical bituminous coal. During the first decade of the nineteenth century, Londons population surpassed 1 million people and its annual energy demand was equivalent to about 4 t of wood per capita used for heating, lighting, and a multitude of small and large manufacturing enterprises. Photosynthesis converts solar radiation into new chemical bonds in wood with inherently low efficiency, and hence all phytomass fuels are produced with very low power densities. Even if London were surrounded by highly productive forests (good beech and oak stands) whose annual wood production averaged 5 t/ha, their cutting would produce fuel with average power density of only about 0.25W/m2 and the city would have needed a reserve of about 800,000 ha (or a forested circle around the city with a radius of just over 50 km) of which it would have to clear-cut, and promptly replant, some 50,000 ha of mature trees (containing 100 t/ha) every year. Cutting and transporting that much wood would have been costly and inconvenient; burning it within the city would have been very polluting: polycyclic organic matter released by wood combustion is highly carcino- genic. Replacing all that wood by charcoal would have needed at least 4 tonnes of wood (15 GJ/t) to produce a tonne of charcoal (29 GJ/t), that is, a 50 percent loss of energy due to charcoaling resulting in a power density rate of just 0.12 W/m2 in order to produce convenient, light, sulfur-free, and nearly smokeless fuel. Such low power densities of energy production would have v a c l a v s m i l 170 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Not surprisingly, by the early nineteenth century all but a very small share of Londons energy came from coal. Similarly sized contemporaneous Beijing managed with much less coal (extracted in small mines just west of the capital since the tenth century) because its per capita energy use was considerably lower, due to minimal heating in winter (hence cotton-padded clothes worn inside) and to the absence of energy-intensive manufacturing enterprises within the city. Obviously, even in 1810, energizing a rapidly growing and industrializing London-like city solely with wood or charcoal would have been a most impractical and exceedingly costly proposition, and large cities and conurba- tions of the late nineteenth century and megalopoli of the twentieth century became direct expressions of high-energy-density fossil fuels produced with high power densities: both coal and crude oil could be extracted with power densities commonly 1,000 and often 10,000 times higher (>100  >1,000 W/m2) than the harvests of phytomass fuels. Similar constraints apply to smelting iron, the metal (now mostly con- verted to a wide variety of steels) that was and remains the signature material of the modern world: its global annual output is larger than that of the next four most important metals (aluminum, copper, zinc, and lead) combined. For nearly three millennia iron was smelted from its ores by using charcoal. By 1800, global production of 1 Mt of iron would have required (with mass ratios of 8/1 for charcoal/metal and 1/5 for charcoal/wood) about 40 Mt of wood, or the cutting down of 4,000 km2 of high-density virgin forest a year. If widely spread it would have been a negligible burden at a time when the world still had large areas of intact virgin forests. By the year 2000, efficiencies had improved (charcoal/metal ratio at 0.75/1, charcoal/wood at 1/4) but the global iron output rose to 580 Mt and it would have required about 1.75 gigatonne (Gt)/year of wood. Even if all of it came from high-yielding tropical plantations (power density of roughly 0.5 W/m2) it would still mean cutting down annually at least 1.75million km2 of trees, an area equal to slightly more than all forests in the European Union. In contrast, when all surface structures needed for coal mining and coking are accounted for, the power density of coke production will be at least 1,000 W/m2 (compared to 0.012 W/m2 for charcoal). Global output of coke thus occupied less than 10,000 km2 of land, a difference of four orders of magnitude. This is certainly one of the best examples illustrating the consequences of using energies produced with low power density in modern A new world of energy 171 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Moreover, besides obvious cost advantages, coke has an added structural superiority as it can support much heavier charges of ore and limestone than the friable and easily crushable charcoal, making larger and cheaper blast furnaces possible. Maximum power of prime movers Maximum power of individual prime movers matters because it determines the maximum magnitude of many tasks. Mass deployment of smaller power units is often impractical or outright impossible: we would not use ten low- power steam locomotives to pull a heavy train; there is no way to harness one hundred horses to pull in a single direction under a drivers command (the maximum in Californias grain fields of the 1890s was more than thirty draft animals harnessed to the earliest combines) and passenger aircrafts with a range of just 200 km cannot be used in a staggered manner to accomplish transoceanic flights. The post-1750 increase in the maximum power of prime movers controlled by a single person during the performance of quotidian tasks has been enormous. The greatest exercise of concentrated power performed daily by millions of people in 1750 was leading draft animals as they plowed or harrowed crop fields or pulled wagons and coaches on roads. A peasant walking behind his weak ox harrowing a field commanded less than 200Wof draft power (or less than a third of mechanical horsepower of 745.6 watts). During the last decades of the nineteenth century, many farmers plowing the Great Plains wheat fields guided six powerful horses (at least 4 kW), and with the first grain combines pulled by thirty-two animals more than 20 kW of draft power was under a single command at the beginning of the twentieth century. Another hundred years later and many Great Plains farmers drive 300-horsepower (224 kW) tractors sitting in air-conditioned cabins, while anybody with a drivers licence can be behind the wheel of an even more powerful SUV (the most powerful one on the market in 2011, the BMW X6, rated 407 hp or 303 kW). This means that since 1750 the maximum power of prime movers commonly controlled by millions of individuals in the course of their daily life rose 1,000-fold (three orders of magnitude), from about 200 W to more than 200 kW. Gains in prime movers commonly used for public transport on land have been evenmore stunning. In 1750 a driver of a fast four-horse coach held reins of about 2,600 W (2.6 kW).

Manually stoked locomotives could do about 120 km/h, while trains in Japan (Shinkansen) or France (trains  grande vitesse) have at their command electric motors with power rating approaching or even exceeding 10 MW. And another order of magnitude has to be added for air travel: pilots of the Boeing 747 (first flown commercially in 1969) or Airbus 380 (in commercial service since 2007) cruising 11 km above sea level have computerized control of more than 100 MW developed by four gas turbines mounted under the planes wings.

Without the latter advances most modern energy conversions would play surprisingly marginal roles because they would be too expensive or too inconvenient to use. If intercontinental flights were still powered by the first generation of commercial gas turbines introduced before 1958 they would consume 50 percent more kerosene. And if the owners of a new house built in California who installed, as is now common, more than fifty lights were to pay their electric bill in pre-1910 electricity prices, this would be at least forty times higher than today, due to the low efficiency of the thermal power plants that provided electric power a century ago. Actually, there is no better example to illustrate the long-term conversion efficiency gains than lighting, as no other common use of energy has seen such gains since 1750. Only a few technical improvements have had such a profound effect on human affairs as extending the day at will (and thus reading, writing, travel, and work in factories), banishing the night and making stairways, houses, and cities safer. In 1750 candles remained themost convenient source of relatively clean but expensive indoor light. They came in a variety of sizes, qualities, and costs and their production eventually became a major manufacturing endeavor  but their wax-to-light efficiency remained dismal: in 1750 an inexpensive (and smelly) tallow candle converted just 0.01 percent of chemical energy in that animal lipid to light. Banishing the darkness thus remained nearly as ineffi- cient during the time of the first encyclopaedists as it was more than one-and- a-half millennia before their time, when Marcus Aurelius wrote down his meditations among the Quadi on the Granua. The first improvement came with lights that used flammable gas made from coal, commercially produced since 1812, which multiplied those dismal efficiencies, with early lamps reach- ing about 0.04 per cent. In 1881, Edisons earliest carbon filaments converted only 0.15 percent of electricity to light.

But by that time the fluorescent lights, commercially available since the 1930s, were on the top, with efficiencies as high as 12 percent. This performance was eventually surpassed by low-pressure sodium lights that convert close to 30 percent of electricity to visible radiation (they have been used almost exclusively for outdoor city illumination and they impart characteristic yellowish hue to cityscapes at night) while the best indoor options (linear fluorescents and screw-in metal halide light bulbs) convert electricity to visible radiation with more than 15 percent efficiency (Table 6.3). Even a small new American house will now have at least thirty lights (or no less than 2.4 kW of installed power) that can be turned on and off by a simple flip or push of a switch. Assuming a mixture of incandescent and fluorescent lights, the overall luminous efficiency will be close to 10 percent and providing the same amount of light (but, obviously, not with the same flexibility and convenience) would require about 10,000 standard paraffin candles. Logistics (and fire hazards) of lighting and extinguishing them aside, it would also be a very costly operation. As for the cost, William Nordhaus calculated that by the end of the twentieth century the true price (in constant monies) of illumination (the cost of the service rather than of the good, in this case a source of light) was four orders of magnitude lower (the actual ratio was about 0.0003) than it was in 1800. Similarly, Roger Fouquets detailed calculation for the United Kingdom showed that, again in constant monies, light was roughly 6,000 times more expensive in 1750 than it was in 2000. Perhaps the second most impressive illustration of improved conversion efficiencies is the performance of prime movers powered by combustion of fossil fuels. The first commercial models of such a machine, Thomas Newcomens atmospheric steam engine, were extraordinarily inefficient, converting no more than half a percent of charged coal into reciprocating motion, and hence suited only for installation at coal mines where there was Table 6.3 Efficiency of lights for indoor illumination Date and type of light Percent 1800 tallow candle 0.01 1850 coal gas light 0.04 1900 incandescent light bulb 0.50 1950 fluorescent light 10.00 2000 metal halide light 16.00 A new world of energy 175 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

In 1750, John Smeaton managed to raise the efficiency above 1 percent and James Watts subsequent famous improve- ments (patent of 1769) were only relatively impressive because the absolute efficiency of his machines remained pitiful, no better than 4 percent during the 1780s. But the gain was sufficient to site them more flexibly away from mines, particularly where the fuel could be brought by vessels. Only high- pressure steam engines did considerably better, surpassing 10 percent by 1850, and by the centurys end the most efficient triple-expansion designs con- verted more than 15 percent of coals thermal energy into useful mechanical energy. That was a performance superior to new internal combustion engines, but those lighter and much more flexible machines were improved rapidly, particularly as Rudolf Diesels inherently efficient high-compression engines began to conquer first shipping and then heavy land transport. In 1897 the final prototype of Diesels new engine had thermal efficiency of almost 35 percent; before the Second World War the best machines surpassed 40 percent and by the year 2000 the massive diesels powering the worlds largest container ships and oil tankers were the worlds most efficient engines, converting just over 50 percent of energy in heavy fuel oil into propulsion (Table 6.4). Their closest competitors in terms of efficiency are large gas turbines (jet engines) that have been powering modern long-distance commercial aviation since the late 1950s: in 1940 the first British and German prototypes converted less than 10 percent of kerosene into useful thrust. By the mid- 1960s the first generation of jetliners had engines operating with 25 percent efficiency, and by the centurys end gas turbines had thermal efficiencies of about 40 percent. These gains have made mass-scale air travel affordable: in 1950, at the beginning of the last decade of air travel powered by reciprocating Table 6.4 Top efficiency of internal combustion engines Date and type of engine Percent 1750 Smeatons (improved Newcomen) steam engine 1.4 1800 Watts improved steam engine 4.0 1850 Best high-pressure locomotive steam engine 6.0 1900 American triple-expansion steam engine 15.0 1950 Best low-speed marine diesel 45.0 2000 Large German diesel engine 51.0 v a c l a v s m i l 176 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Per capita consumption of useful energy Supply of phytomass fuels and mechanical power (human and animal mus- cles, waterwheels and windmills  relatively common in some regions, rare or absent in others) remained low and stagnating for millennia. My recon- struction of fuel supply in Rome during the first two centuries of the Common Era came up with at least 10 GJ and possibly 15 GJ/capita. Estimates for average annual wood consumption in London of 1300 put this at 1.5 t or just over 20GJ/capita, whichmeans that the national average had to be below 20 GJ, not that different from the Roman energy consumption. Peasants on the deforested North China Plain burned annually no more than 10 to 15 GJ/capita of straw, roots, leaves, and grasses even during the early decades of the twentieth century. Extraction of fossil fuels had multiplied the average supply, often in just one or two generations. Historical comparisons of energy use per capita rates are calculated after converting different fuels and other forms of primary energy (hydro, nuclear, geothermal, wind, and solar electricity) into a common energy denominator. The joule should be the preferred choice, but international statistics used to convert to a tonne of coal equivalent (tce, equal to 29 GJ, because it took the highest quality coal as the standard); but since the 1980s all of the most often cited sources (United Nations, OECD, the annual survey of world energy by British Petroleum) use a tonne of oil equivalent (toe, equal to 42 GJ or 1.45 tce). British data show the average per capita use of primary energy rising from about 30 GJ in 1750 to just over 150 GJ in the year 2000, a relatively small (five-fold) multiple because the country already had a fairly high per capita use by 1750; the French use, reliably traceable since 1850, went from 20 GJ to 180GJ in 2000, a nine-fold increase in 150 years. Themultiple for Japan, a latecomer to modernization (begun only after the Meiji Restoration of 1868) was nearly eighteen-fold during the twentieth century (from about 10 GJ to just over 170GJ/capita), and Chinas belated modernization was energized by going from just 1.5 GJ/capita (fossil fuels and hydroelectricity, excluding phytomass fuels) in 1950 to 35 GJ in 2000, a twenty-three-fold gain in just five decades (Table 6.5). Impressive as these multiples may be, they obscure the real gains in the consumption of modern energy: because of the just-reviewed gains in typical A new world of energy 177 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Average US phytomass energy use in 1850 was very high, about 100 GJ/capita, compared to about 350 GJ/capita for all fossil and biomass fuels in the year 2000. But with typical mid-nineteenth- century combustion efficiencies at only about 10 percent, the useful energy in 1850 was just 10 GJ/capita while the overall energy conversion efficiency in the US economy reached 40 percent by the year 2000, delivering roughly 150 GJ/year of useful energy services, a rate nearly fifteen-fold higher than in 1850. Fouquets British data disaggregate the useful gains: for all industrial power (in 1750 it was delivered by human and animal labor, waterwheels, windmills, and a few steam engines; in 2000 it was mostly produced by electric motors and internal combustion engines) the multiple was thirteen- fold in 250 years; for heating (in 1750 a mixture of wood, charcoal, and coal; by 2000 mostly natural gas) it was fourteen-fold; for all passenger transport (in 1750 horses, carts, coaches, barges, ships; in 2000 cars, buses, trains, ships, and airplanes) it was nearly 900-fold; and lighting gains take the top place, as the trajectory from candles and oil lamps in 1750 to an assortment of electric lights in the year 2000 ended up with about 11,000 times more light per capita. For China my best estimates are an increase from no more than 0.3 GJ/ capita of useful energies in 1950 to about 15 GJ in 2000, a fifty-fold increase in just two generations. These multiples are the proper metric that reveals the achievements of modern civilization; they are behind large gains in produc- tive capacity, they created comfortable interiors, they brought previously unimaginable mobility (of materials, goods, and people) and they generated so much light that the night-time satellite images show most of Western Table 6.5 Average annual consumption of primary energy (rounded to the nearest 5 GJ/capita and including all phytomass and fossil fuels and primary electricity) 1750 1800 1850 1900 1950 2000 China 10 10 10 <15 <20 40 UK 30 60 80 115 100 150 France <20 20 25 55 65 180 Japan 10 10 10 10 25 170 USA <80 <100 105 135 245 345 World <20 20 25 35 40 65 v a c l a v s m i l 178 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Maximum energies of weapons Winning armed conflicts has not always required superior weapons: superior planning could decide the outcome even before a conflict began; nimble combat tactics could reverse an apparent rout into a sudden victory; well-timed betrayal could open the gates of fortified cities; coastal blockade could weaken and demoralize entire populations; epidemic dis- ease and inclement weather could stop marching armies, and unco- operative winds could divert attacking fleets of sailing ships. But in most conflicts weapons made the difference. The damage they inflict is due to a sudden release of kinetic or thermal energy or their combined impact, and discharge of these energies is determined by the maximum capability of the prime movers that set them into action. When seen from this vantage point, all armed conflicts can be classified into four distinct periods: those powered by animate prime movers; those dominated by low-energy explosives; those relying on high-energy explosives; and those that deploy nuclear weapons. All warfare from prehistory until the late Middle Ages used weapons powered solely by animate prime movers, overwhelmingly by human muscles. In close combat warriors used cutting (axes, swords) or piercing (daggers, lances) weapons, while injuring and killing from a distance relied on the piercing powers of spears and arrows launched by using bows or more powerful crossbows. The invention of gunpowder, with the explosive mixture first solidly documented before the end of the twelfth century in China, and its use reaching Europe just before the end of the thirteenth century, introduced a new powerful prime mover. Although it is now classed as a low-velocity explosive, gunpowders detonation speed was (depending on the composition of the powder, always dominated by KNO3, usually about 75 percent of the mass, and always containing charcoal, but not always with added sulfur) at least 400 and up to 1,300 metres per second (m/s) while sword cuts had usual velocities less than 50 m/s. Gunpowder-propelled projectiles from field cannons and soon afterwards from ship guns raised the destructive power of weapons by an order of magnitude for personal weapons (1,000 J or 1 kJ for the best muskets), and by three orders of magnitude when launching projectiles from field or ship guns: in medieval cannons it imparted 50 kJ to A new world of energy 179 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The destructive energy of weapons was greatly raised by the introduc- tion of new, high-energy explosives (made by the nitration of cellulose, glycerine, phenol, and toluene) and by using those explosives to fill gun cartridges, and later bombs and rockets, that detonated on impact, with their explosive energy far surpassing the impact of their kinetic energy. Detonation velocity of new high-energy explosives kept on rising, from about 5,000m/s for dynamite (Alfred Nobel patented his detonator in 1863) to 6,900 m/s for TNT (synthesized first in 1863) to 8,800 m/s for RDX (Royal Demolition eXplosive, made first by Georg Friedrich Henning in 1899), and to just over 10,000 m/s for ONC (octanitrocubane). Again, as with the escalation of destructive kinetic energy from arrows to cannon balls, there were destructive gains of explosive energies spanning orders of magnitude. The first modern field gun, the French Canon 75 mm modle 1897 (com- monly known as Le Soixante-Quinze) fired shells filled with nearly 700 g of picric acid whose explosive energy reached 2.6 MJ. Perhaps the best- known gun of the Second World War was the German anti-aircraft Flak (Flugzeugabwehrkanone) 18, whose variant was also used in Tiger tanks; it fired shrapnel shells whose explosive energy was 4MJ. But the most powerful explosives of the Second World War were the massive bombs which were dropped on cities. The most powerful bomb carried by the Flying Fortress (Boeing B-17) had explosive energy of 3.8 GJ. And during the last month of the SecondWorld War, the United States dropped two bombs, at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and at Nagasaki three days later, that introduced the fourth category of weapons powered by nuclear fission, and later (since 1952) also by fusion. Yet again, the multiplication of destructive energies took place, this time in record time. The Hiroshima bomb released 63 trillion joules (TJ) of energy, and in 1961 the Soviets tested above Novaya Zemlya their most powerful fusion bomb (Tsar Bomba) that released 209 quadrillion joules (PJ) of energy. The two superpowers had eventually amassed roughly 5,000 strategic nuclear warheads with the aggregate destructive energy of about 20 exajoules (EJ, 1018), a sum so incredibly large that that lunacy actually served us well, preventing a global thermonuclear war that, all too obviously, nobody could win. The truly staggering progression of max- imum destructive energy of explosive weapons during the twentieth century is shown in Table 6.6. v a c l a v s m i l 180 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Put another way, the epochal energy transition created what Nordhaus rightly called tectonic shifts in output and consumption. But if many fundamental whys and hows of modern history cannot be properly under- stood without appreciating the quantities and qualities of modern energy uses, arraying those accomplishments alone is no substitute for more complex perspectives: energetic determinism, as any other kind of reduc- tionist explanation, is bound to mislead. Many examples could be cited in order to illustrate the limits of energy- based determinism. With its enormous fossil fuel, nuclear, and hydroenergy resources, the USSR was a true energy superpower but it squandered that enviable patrimony, mostly because of its chronic economicmismanagement and a terribly inefficient quest for global hegemony. In contrast, post-Second World War Japan was not prevented by its lack of energy resources from becoming a great economic power, and, moreover, one with perhaps the worlds most efficient use of energy  but that was not enough to prevent the countrys protracted post-1990 economic and social decline. Another reveal- ing contrast illustrating the limits of energy-based explanations is to note that formany decades the US per capita energy use has been twice as high as in the richest countries of the European Union, yet most of Americas quality-of-life indicators lag behind the European averages. A third and final contrast, from yet another perspective, is the fact that the timeless intellectual accomplishments of the last quarter millennium  be they Mozarts absorbing operas, Melvilles bold chronicling of a quest on Table 6.6 Maximum energy of explosive weapons, 19002000 Date and type of weapon J 1900 Picrite-filled shell from French 75mmmodle 1897 gun 2,600,000 1940Amatol/TNT-filled shrapnel fromGerman 88mmFlak 4,000,000 1944 The largest bomb carried by Boeing B-17 3,800,000,000 1945 Hiroshima bomb 63,000,000,000,000 1961 Soviet Tsar Bomba tested in 1961 209,000,000,000,000,000 A new world of energy 181 of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139196079.007 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Physically and thermo- dynamically, everything can be reduced to conversions of energy; but why and how we have deployed those energies has been always subject to human aspirations and fears. Considering both of these perspectives should bring a deeper understanding of history. There is clearly an ambivalent link between energy and history. Energy sources and prime movers delimit the options of human history and deter- mine the tempo of life, and, everything else being equal, thermodynamics requires that higher socio-economic complexity must be supported by more intensive flows of energy. And yet neither the possession of abundant energy sources nor their high consumption guarantees a nations security, economic comfort, or personal happiness. Access to energies and the modes of their use constrain the options for our action but do not explain the sources of our aspirations and reasons for our choices, and do not preordain success or failure of individual societies at a particular time in history.
