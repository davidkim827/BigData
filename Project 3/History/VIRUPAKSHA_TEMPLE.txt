The toponym Hampitraditionally known as Pampa-kshetra, Kishkindha-kshetra or Bhaskara-kshetrais derived from Pampa, another name of goddess  in Hindu theology. According to mythology, the maiden Parvati resolves to marry the loner ascetic . Her parents learn of her desire and discourage her, but she pursues her desire. Shiva is lost in yogic meditation, oblivious to the world; Parvati appeals to the gods for help to awaken him and gain his attention. Indra sends the god the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affectionto awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire. Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns Kama to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva; she begins to live like him and engage in the same activitiesasceticism,  and awakening him and attracting his interest. Shiva meets Parvati in disguised form and tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva's weaknesses and personality problems.  Parvati refuses to listen and insists in her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married. According to , Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic, yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill, now a part of Hampi, to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life. Shiva is also called Pampapati (lit. "husband of Pampa"). The river near the Hemkuta Hill came to be known as Pampa river. The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the  word Hampa and the place Parvati pursued Shiva came to be known as Hampe or Hampi. Hampi, also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a   located in east-central , India. It became the centre of the Hindu  capital in the 14thcentury. Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, state Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the , with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city after , and probably India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal. The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.VIRUPAKSHA TEMPLEHistoryThe temple's history is uninterrupted from about the 7th century. The Virupaksha-Pampa sanctuary existed well before the Vijayanagara capital was located here. Inscriptions referring to Shiva date back to the 9th and 10th centuries.] What started as a small shrine grew into a large complex under the  rulers. Evidence indicates there were additions made to the temple in the late  and  periods, though most of the temple buildings are attributed to the Vijayanagar period. The huge temple building was built by Lakkana Dandesha, a chieftain under the ruler  of the . Under the Vijayanagara rulers, in the middle of the 14th century, there began a flowering of native art and culture. When the rulers were defeated by Muslim invaders in the 16th century, most of the wonderful decorative structures and creations were systematically destroyed. The religious sect of Virupaksha-Pampa did not end with the destruction of the city in 1565. Worship there has persisted throughout the years.
